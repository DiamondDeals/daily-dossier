I thought you said you fixed it so that when it encountered an error it would stop and pause for 15 minutes. If after that 15 minutes, it immediately encounters another error it will stop. It should also re-do the one that it got an error on. Or figure out a way that it confirms before posting whether or not it has a description... I don't know, you're the genius around these parts.. I am just the ruller of it.
