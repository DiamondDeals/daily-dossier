12,What's that one thing you do every week that drains your time?,r/Entrepreneur,getyourpmp,7,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1lu3i17/whats_that_one_thing_you_do_every_week_that/,"Hey founders!

What's one repetitive task in your business you wish you could automate?

Could be anything like:

* Invoicing
* Cold outreach
* Client reporting
* Order follow-ups
* SEO tasks(keyword research, audits)
* Scheduling
* Proposal writing

I'm exploring automation ideas for solo founders and small teams and think your opinion would be very helpful to build something that's actually useful. 

What's that one thing you do every week that drains your time?

Appreciate any insights!

12,Built a full real estate automation system for $500/month,r/automation,Business_Gazelle_246,75,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1lspw8h/built_a_full_real_estate_automation_system_for/,"I recently built a full workflow automation system for a real estate brokerage using n8n, GPT-4, Airtable, Twilio, and DocuSign — everything from lead capture to contract generation is now automated.

It cost the client $500/month and handles:
	•	Lead intake from website/chat/ads
	•	AI lead scoring and agent assignment
	•	Tour scheduling + feedback
	•	Auto-generated contracts via GPT
	•	Slack alerts, CRM updates, and more"
12,Spent 10 hours building this AI automation on a Saturday because... who needs weekends? (Day 5/50),r/automation,akhilpanja,48,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1lshkcq/spent_10_hours_building_this_ai_automation_on_a/,"Alright Reddit, hear me out.

It's Saturday night. Normal people are out having fun. Me? I just spent 10 hours straight debugging webhook connections and arguing with merge nodes because apparently, I hate myself.

**The Challenge:** 50 days, 50 AI automations. No breaks. No weekends. Just pure, caffeinated determination. 5th Day it is!

**Today's Build:** An AI Content Repurposing Machine that turns one piece of content into 6 platform-optimized versions. Because manually rewriting the same post for LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, newsletter, and blog is SO 2023.

https://preview.redd.it/mujgwmx9u3bf1.png?width=1868&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6b3652161141f08332cca43b0ee8673f5d04805

**What it does:**

* You write once
* AI transforms it for each platform (with proper formatting, hashtags, everything)
* Saves to Google Sheets
* 3 hours of work → 47 seconds

**The Stack:**

* n8n (self-hosted because I'm cheap)
* DeepSeek API (way cheaper than GPT-4, almost as smart)
* Some questionable CSS animations that I'm oddly proud of
* My sanity (deprecated)

**Pain Points I Discovered:**

* Webhook URLs have a `-test` suffix that disappears in production (learned this at hour 7)
* Merge nodes in n8n are like that friend who says they'll help you move but never shows up
* The expression `{{ $json.content }}` vs `{{ $json.body.content }}` cost me 2 hours of my life

**Watch the demo video through my Google's Drive link** in the comments - Warning: Contains excessive celebration when it finally worked

**The UI:** Okay, I may have gone overboard with the dark theme and animations. But after staring at code for 10 hours, making things glow seemed like a good idea. Judge me.

**GitHub:** Get the JSON workflow in the comments - Feel free to roast my node structure

Real talk though - this actually saves me hours every week. I write these automation posts once and boom, ready for every platform.

**Tomorrow's preview:** Day 6 - Building an AI that... actually, I should probably sleep first and figure that out.

How's everyone else's weekend going? Anyone else building stuff instead of having a social life?

P.S. - If you're a client reading this, yes, I'm available for projects. My weekend rate is 2x because apparently, I don't know how to rest."
11,"E-commerce Industry News Recap 🔥 Week of July 7th, 2025",r/ecommerce,adventurepaul,3,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1lu51jb/ecommerce_industry_news_recap_week_of_july_7th/,"Hi r/ecommerce \- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 4 years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon deployed its ONE MILLIONTH worker robot last week across its more than 300 facilities. The company also shared that its entire fleet will soon be powered by a newly launched generative AI model that will coordinate the movement of its robots within its fulfillment centers, reducing the travel time of the fleet by 10% and enabling faster and more cost-effective package deliveries. Plus they don't take bathroom breaks — which is something Amazon has always disdained about its human liabilities workers.
___
As part of the package introduced as the **“One Big Beautiful Bill Act,”** the U.S. will repeal the **de minimis exemption** allowing imports under $800 to enter the country duty and tax free on July 1, 2027. President Trump already ended the exemption for imports from China and Hong Kong in May, but now the bill extends the policy to all countries. Moving forward, parcels will be subject to more stringent inspection and different entry processes, with the Trump administration expected to provide details about what to expect at a later time. The bill also establishes a penalty for any person attempting to use de minimis entry in a way that “violates any other provision” of U.S. customs laws in the amount of $5,000 for the first violation and up to $10,000 for subsequent violations.
___
**Google** introduced **Offerwall**, a new tool that lets publishers offer readers alternative ways to access content and new ways for publishers to monetize their content, beyond traditional impression-based advertising or affiliate marketing. Options for accessing content include: Watching a video ad, Completing a survey, Making a micro payment, and Signing up to a newsletter. Google tested the offering with more than 1,000 publishers and has now made it generally available in Ad Manager. The company claims that publishers who have implemented Offerwall have seen an average revenue uplift of 9%.
___
**OpenAI** is expanding into high-ticket consulting, offering AI customization services starting at $10M to large companies and government agencies. Through a team of “forward deployed engineers,” OpenAI is offering to help clients fine-tune GPT-4o using proprietary data and build tailored applications that can solve problems specific to their needs, effectively creating their own custom ChatGPT portals. The consulting service already has buyers including large software firms and governments, according to The Information sources, with some clients agreeing to spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars over multiple years. OpenAI formed a dedicated consulting team earlier this year and has since hired around a dozen people for it, including several who previously worked at Palantir. A source told The Information that the goal of the division is to figure out whether OpenAI can develop technology that an enterprise customer would be willing to pay $1B or more for.
___
In response to **Meta** aggressively going after **OpenAI's researchers**, Sam Altman wrote a memo to all OpenAI researchers, pitching why staying at the company is the only answer for those looking to build artificial general intelligence and hinting that OpenAI is evaluating compensation for the entire research organization. He dismissed Meta's recruiting efforts, claiming that what the company is doing could lead to deep cultural problems in the future. He noted that despite trying for a long time, Meta has been unable to poach their ""top people."" He went on to make an emotional plea about how OpenAI is a mission-driven organization, even though it's simultaneously actively looking to convert into a for-profit organization. Lastly he slammed Mark Zuckerberg for jumping from one trend to another by saying, ""Long after Meta has moved on to their next flavor of the week, or defending their social moat, we will be here, day after day, year after year, figuring out how to do what we do better than anyone else.""
___
**President Trump** said on Friday that the U.S. “pretty much has a deal” for an American company to acquire the U.S. branch of **TikTok** and that he'll be restarting talks with China this week to approve it. Despite three extensions on the ban… a deal might actually be nearing. The Information reports that TikTok is building a new version of its app for users in the U.S., internally known as “M2,” with plans to launch to app stores on September 5th. Users would eventually have to download the new app to be able to continue using the service, but the existing app will work until March of next year. At this moment, it's unclear if ByteDance will share TikTok's algorithm with the U.S. buyers, license the algorithm, or deliver an amended version exclusive for the U.S. market. 
___
**Meta** announced several updates to its messaging and advertising offerings at its global “Conversations” conference in Miami on Tuesday including 1) centralized ad creation to build campaigns across WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, 2) WhatsApp buttons integrated with Google Business Profiles, 3) WhatsApp Order Tracking for Shopify, Woo, and other platforms, 4) direct calling for larger brands to be able to call back customers, and 5) tiered pricing for brands to scale up their usage (and payments to Meta). 
___
Last week Bloomberg reported that **Nintendo** pulled its products from Amazon-com after a disagreement over unauthorized sales, which resulted in **Amazon** missing out on the recent debut of Nintendo's Switch 2. The article said that Nintendo had noticed that third-party merchants were buying games in bulk in Southeast Asia and listing them for sale in the U.S. at prices that undercut Nintendo's advertised rates, and that despite Amazon's attempts to resolve the issue, Nintendo ultimately opted to pull its products from Amazon in the U.S. However both companies deny the allegations. Regardless, where are the Nintendo Switches?! Nintendo's website shows the Switch 2 available for sale on GameStop, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — but noticeably absent from that lineup is Amazon. Certain Switch titles like Donkey Kong Bananza are now appearing for pre-order on Amazon's U.S. website, but the Switch 2 device remains unavailable.
___
**OpenAI** introduced a new tool allowing retailers to create AI-powered shopping assistants in **Shopify** with just a few clicks. Using the Storefront Managed Compute Platform (MCP) and the OpenAI Responses API, developers can build agents that can: 1) Search products Answer product questions, 2) Explain differences between items, 3) Add items to a cart, 4) Generate checkout links. Users can enter prompts like, “I am looking for a tri suit for a cold weather triathlon,” and the assistant will search for options from the store's inventory to show the shopper. If the shopper picks one of the options, the assistant can automatically move to checkout.
___
**Google** is testing a price change rich result that indicates if the price is low, high, or typical, as spotted by Brodie Clark, an independent SEO Consultant. When clicking on the extension, a pop-up informs the user that insights are based on the last 90 days. The experiment appears to be an extension of the price drop rich result which has been detailed within Google's documentation for several years.
___
**eBay** is testing a feature that would allow buyers to scroll through multiple listing images directly on the search results page without needing to click through the listing page first. Some sellers have praised the move for improving the buyer experience, while others raised concerns that the new capability, along with eBay's vague Promoted Listing terms, could lead to more aggressive add attribution, possibly charging sellers for buyer interactions like swiping through the photo carousels. Others pointed out issues with the carousel skipping videos, overlapping key product details, and boosting visibility for competing listings through a “Find Similar” button. Can't please everyone!
___
**Amazon Business** is partnering with **Mathnasium**, the math tutoring franchise with more than 1,000 U.S. centers, to help locations procure classroom and operational supplies like toner, paper, and student incentives. The move aims to streamline purchasing, reduce admin tasks, and give centers access to bulk pricing and digital spend management tools. Since launching in 2015, Amazon Business has added more than 8M customers globally and reported $35B in annualized gross sales in 2023.
___
**Meta** is testing proactive AI chatbots that send unprompted follow-up messages to users in an effort to boost retention and engagement on its AI Studio platform, a no-code platform where anyone can build custom chatbots and digital personas that Meta launched in 2024, according to leaked documents viewed by Business Insider. The initiative, internally dubbed “Project Omni,” is being developed with contractor support from Alignerr, and allow bots to follow up with users up to 14 days after a conversation, but only if the user previously sent at least five messages.
___
**Alibaba** and **Wix** partnered to help entrepreneurs and small businesses expand globally. Wix merchants can now become Global Gold Suppliers on Alibaba via a new app integration, streamlining product syncing and access to millions of global buyers, while Alibaba sellers can use Wix’s AI-powered tools to build branded D2C and B2B storefronts. The partnership also enables Wix users to source products directly through a dedicated Alibaba wholesale marketplace, with AI-driven onboarding and product discovery tools to further simplify cross-border trade on the horizon.
___
**Perplexity** is [launching](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/perplexity-launches-a-200-monthly-subscription-plan/) a $200/month subscription plan for its power users called Perplexity Max, which offers unlimited access to its spreadsheet and report generation tool, Labs, and early access to new features like its upcoming AI-powered browser, Comet. Max subscribers will also get priority access to any Perplexity services using the latest LLMs like OpenAI o3-pro and Claude Opus 4. In 2024, Perplexity generated roughly $34M in revenue, mostly with its $20/month Pro plan, but still burned about $65M in cash due to heavy spending on cloud servers and buying access to AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic.
___
**A new AlixPartners survey** reports the biggest slowdown in online shopping in more than 10 years, with double-digit YoY declines across key categories like office supplies (-13%), sporting goods (-12%), and cosmetics, furniture, and electronics (each -10%). Tariff uncertainty and rising delivery and return costs are pushing retailers to tighten shipping perks and consumers to delay or reshuffle purchases, with 66% saying they’d switch to U.S. goods if overseas prices rise 10%.
___
**In corporate shakeups this week… DHL eCommerce** appointed Scott Ashbaugh, who currently serves as the company's Chief Commercial Officer, as its new Americas CEO, effective July 1st, following the retirement of Lee Spratt. **BigCommerce** appointed Anil Kamath, former Adobe Fellow and VP of Technology, to its board of directors. **Pattern** appointed Sue Taylor, former Chief Accounting Officer at Meta and LinkedIn, and Ann Mather, former Chief Financial Officer at Pixar, to its board of directors. And last but not least, **eToro** appointed Laura Unger, a former SEC commissioner, and Lior Shemesh, the CFO of Wix, to its board of directors.
___
**Microsoft** is laying off 9,000 workers, or about 4% of its workforce, mostly targeting salespeople and workers in the Xbox division, in its second major wave of layoffs this year, aiming to control costs while ramping up its AI spending. The terminations follow a round of layoffs in May that hit 6,000 people across product and engineering teams. Matt Turnbull, the executive produce at Xbox Game Studios, [took heat](https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt) for suggesting in a since-deleted LinkedIn post that affected employees should use ChatGPT and Copilot to “help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.”
___
**TikTok** is laying off more workers in its U.S. e-commerce division including moderation workers, product team members, and staff who work with creators and sellers, marking its third round of layoffs for that team since April. In a message to staff, the company said it's spent the past month assessing how to “best support our evolving global e-commerce business in alignment with our mission and evolving goals,” and that it's “repositioning resources and reducing complexity in pursuit of strengthened collaboration and increased efficiency.”
___
**Mirakl** and **Shopify** expanded their partnership with the release of the Mirakl Platform Connector for Shopify, aimed at helping large enterprises rapidly deploy and manage marketplaces. The connector is designed to reduce integration effort by up to 80% through prebuilt synchronization of taxonomy, products, sellers, and orders, and supports mixed 1P/3P checkouts, theme and headless storefronts, and real-time updates. Honestly, starting a marketplace has never been easier. We're about to enter the era of niche marketplaces.
___
**eBay** overhauled its tracking experience for both buyers and sellers, introducing a more visual and intuitive interface across Seller Hub and buyer shipment flows. The new system, which rolls out in late July, provides sellers with enhanced order tracking visualization and buyers with a unified delivery view, including separate tracking for outbound and return shipments. By offering clearer updates, especially on delays, eBay aims to reduce “item not received” claims, minimize customer service inquiries, and improve seller ratings and buyer trust.
___
**Walmart** released its 2025 Marketplace Seller Playbook, highlighting new tools and programs to help sellers scale across channels and international markets. Key initiatives include expanded Walmart Fulfillment Services, which the company says is now 15% cheaper than competitors, and a new Multichannel Solutions feature allowing sellers to fulfill orders from other platforms. The playbook also shares how new sellers can tap into up to $75,000 in savings, leverage Walmart Connect for 7x sales lift through ads, and access global markets like Canada, Mexico, and Chile, as well as details growth in categories like Premium Beauty, Collectibles, and Automotive, positioning Walmart as an increasingly competitive alternative to Amazon.
___
**Two upcoming New York state laws** are set to impact retailers: one requiring algorithmic pricing disclosure, which takes effect July 8, and another expanding return policy disclosure rules to online sellers, effective August 7, 2025. The National Retail Federation has sued to block the pricing law, arguing it unfairly stigmatizes dynamic pricing methods that often benefit consumers. Meanwhile, the updated return policy law mandates that online retailers clearly display or hyperlink their return terms near the product or before billing info is requested, aligning digital compliance with in-store standards.
___
**Shopify** launched App Bridge Reviews API, which lets app developers collect reviews directly from the merchant admin, as opposed to having to visit the app listing in the Shopify App Store. The move reduces friction for leaving reviews, which can ultimately improve review volume, helping both merchants and developers with additional feedback.
___
**Alibaba's Taobao** announced that it will be issuing $7B in subsidies over the next 12 months for certain purchases to boost consumption in China amid economic sluggishness and deflationary concerns. Rolled out over the next 12 months, the incentives include “red envelopes” (a digital form of cash gifts), product discounts, and reduced delivery and commission fees, particularly through Taobao’s “flash purchase” feature. The move aligns with broader government efforts to spark spending through policy stimulus, as the country grapples with a weak property sector, labor concerns, and ongoing trade tensions with the U.S.
___
**Zoho** unveiled Zoho Commerce 2.0, a fully redesigned and AI-enhanced e-commerce platform with new features including AI-generated product descriptions, abandoned cart recovery, loyalty programs, and BOGO-style coupon engines. The platform also now supports localized selling, WhatsApp Commerce, mobile apps, B2B functionality like quote requests and credit limits, advanced analytics, and multi-location fulfillment with carrier integration, with a redesigned interface that the company says is faster, cleaner, and more intuitive.
___
**Circle**, the issuer of USDC stablecoin that recently went public, applied for a national trust charter, which is a type of banking license issued in the U.S. that allows an institution to operate as a national trust bank, but without taking traditional deposits like a commercial bank. The charter, if approved, would create First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A., which would manage USDC reserves and offer digital asset custody for institutions. The move would align Circle with upcoming U.S. stablecoin legislation included in the GENIUS Act and follows Circle’s June IPO, which tripled its share price and boosted its valuation above $18B.
___
**Amazon** is now formally integrating its 16 Leadership Principles into employee evaluations using a new three-tiered rating system, as part of CEO Andy Jassy’s push for a more disciplined and performance-focused workforce, according to documents obtained by Business Insider. Starting this review cycle, corporate employees will be scored on how well they embody principles like “customer focus” and “cost discipline,” alongside performance and potential, to determine raises and performance plans, with only 5% of employees able to achieve the top “role model” rating. Wow, between return to office mandates, layoffs, relocations, and now leadership principle evaluations — Amazon sounds like a great place to work.
___
As tariffs drive up the cost of manufacturing, more brands are turning to **tariff engineering**, a legal strategy that involves tweaking product materials, features, or classifications, to reduce duty rates. There are currently more than 5,000 product classification codes used by over 200 countries when assessing tariffs, and small changes can make big differences in costs. Walmart, for example, has been working with suppliers to swap out materials like aluminum, which is subject to 50% tariffs, for alternatives like fiberglass. While effective, the practice carries legal risks if deemed purely evasive, as seen in Ford's $365M penalty for importing vans with added rears seats to avoid a 25% duty on cargo vehicles.
___
**TikTok Shop** officially launched in Japan, a market which has been dominated by Amazon Japan and Rakuten up until now. The app currently has over 33M monthly users in the country, with an average screen time of 96 minutes per day, according to the Japan External Trade Organization. Japan is TikTok Shop’s 17th market, following launches in the U.S., the UK, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam, among others, and introduces another Chinese player to the country’s e-commerce market, which already includes Temu and Shein.
___
**Reliance Industries**, the largest conglomerate in India with businesses spanning energy, petrochemicals, telecommunications, retail, and digital services, is transferring all of its consumer goods brands to a new wholly-owned subsidiary as it readies for an IPO for its retail business. The brands, spanning apparel, fashion, food, personal care, and beverages, will be moved to the new New Reliance Consumer Products Ltd (RCPL), allowing the capital-intensive consumer brands to attract a different set of investors.
___
**Australia's consumer regulator** put Shopify and Meta on notice, urging them to take action against online “ghost stores” that pretend to be local businesses to dupe shoppers. The agency issued a public warning about ghost stores on Thursday and announced it had written to the two companies after an investigation by Guardian Australia identified more than 140 of these websites. Meta said it would look into it, and Shopify has yet to comment.
___
**Bol**, the largest e-commerce marketplace in the Netherlands and Belgium, is now allowing sellers from outside the EU to join for the first time, with the first 100 non-EU sellers expected to onboard this year. The company emphasized strict quality control for offerings from countries such as China and made a rule that products must be stocked within Europe (ie: no direct-from-factory offerings like Temu). Bol first opened its doors to 3rd party EU sellers in 2011, and its network has since grown to over 50,000 sellers.
___
**France** imposed a €40M penalty on **Shein** for using “deceptive commercial practices towards consumers regarding price reductions,” following a year long investigation into the issue. That took a year? The French competition and anti-fraud office claims that Shein misled customers on price deals and on its environmental impact, particularly by raising prices on products before putting them “on sale” back to their original price. (Best Buy, are you paying attention?) In 57% of cases, Shein's advertised promotions actually offered “no price reduction” and in 19% of cases, the price drop was “less significant than announced.”
___
**FAST channels**, which are free, ad-supported streaming channels like those showing “Gunsmoke” or “Murder She Wrote”, are seeing up to a 50% drop in ad revenue this year, even as viewership continues to rise. The decline stems from a saturated ad market and growing competition from premium services like Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, which have begun selling ads themselves. On that note, Amazon announced that it is shutting down **Freevee** this August, its free streaming TV service that it launched in 2019 underneath IMDb, to concentrate exclusively on its free viewing options within its Prime Video app.
___
As **Amazon Prime Day** approaches on July 8th, NordVPN researchers have identified over 120,000 fake Amazon-related websites launched in the past two months, aiming to scam shoppers through phishing, malware, and counterfeit product schemes. The spike in impersonation scams represents an 80% increase during last year’s event — which I'm sure AI and the ease of launching websites has played a role in the uptick. Amazon urges shoppers to only verify purchases directly on its official site or app and warns that it never asks for payments by email, phone, or gift card.
___
**A Bitcoin miner** bagged a reward of 3.173 BTC ($349,028) by mining Bitcoin block number 903,883 late Thursday night. Solo CK, the non-profit service that enables Bitcoin miners to attempt to mine solo blocks, said that a miner of this size has about a 1 in 2,800 chance of solving a block every day, or once every 8 years on average. Lucky miner!
___
**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** An Indian software engineer named Soham Parekh was called out on X for working 3-4 jobs at a time (or possibly more), targeting YC companies. Other founders came out of the woodwork in the replies talking about how they had either hired or interviewed the guy at some point. The funniest reply said, “We had him on the team for about 3 months. He was confident and well spoken in meetings but hardly ever finished any of his work. Frequently other devs would step in to finish the task and get it shipped. The final straw was when he was caught masturbating on an all hands zoom call. He forgot his camera was on.” 
___
Plus 16 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Grammarly** acquiring **Superhuman**, an AI-powered e-mail client for business users that offers features like e-mail summaries, read status tracking, and follow-up reminders, for an undisclosed amount.
___
I hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!

11,"High-Ticket Coaching Services - Need Simple, Automatable CRM for Deal Tracking ($240K ARR)",r/CRM,who-are-u-a-fed,1,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRM/comments/1lo9yz2/highticket_coaching_services_need_simple/,"I run ops for a high-ticket career coaching business ($240K ARR, $5K-$10K deals) and I'm struggling to find a CRM that fits our needs. I'm a data engineer/analyst by trade but new to running ops.

I’m good with coding/automations/APIs but my business partner is not, and it’s just us two.

## What I want:
- Automate 80% of data entry (especially contacts, deals, touchpoints)
- Coach spends &lt;20 mins a few times per week just reconciling, not entering data
- Simple data model: contacts → accounts → deals → touchpoints (emails, Zoom meetings)
- Clean UI for non-technical coach to review pipeline and make edits
- Under $100/month
- When I need serious analytics, I'll build a pipeline to BigQuery - CRM is just the operational interface

## What I don't want:
- Hours of manual data entry every week
- Writing custom CSV upload/download scripts
- Complex API integrations just to get basic automations working
- Paying someone offshore to babysit data quality issues
- A CRM that requires a training course to use effectively
- ""Flexible"" platforms that need 20 hours of setup and break constantly

## Automation examples:
- Zoom meeting ends → auto-log touchpoint with duration/participants to deal
- Stripe payment → auto-link to deal and mark won
- Calendar booking → create deal/contact
- Email exchanges → log as touchpoints

## What I've tried (10+ hours each):

### HubSpot ❌
- **Pros:** Good integrations, touchpoint tracking
- **Cons:** Useful features locked behind $100+/month. UI is clunky for daily use. Over-engineered for our simple needs.

### Pipedrive ⚠️
- **Pros:** Clean UI, $25/month, good API
- **Cons:** Stripe integration sucks. Activity tracking is basic. Data model doesn't fit services well - lots of manual workarounds needed.

### Klaviyo ❌
- **Pros:** Amazing automations, seamless Stripe integration, great event tracking
- **Cons:** Built for e-commerce. No deal pipeline. Can't track $10K coaching sales cycles.

### Monday.com ❌
- **Pros:** Flexible
- **Cons:** Too flexible - requires tons of custom setup that breaks easily. Overkill for simple contact→deal→touchpoint flow.

Maybe I'm using CRMs wrong, but they all claim to automate data entry yet seem to require tons of manual work or custom coding. I don't want to spend hours writing CSV upload scripts or complex API integrations.

**Am I missing something obvious, or do I just need to build a simple frontend on our existing data?**"
10,Help me choose my brand name (and website domain),r/Entrepreneur,offweekender,1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1lu93it/help_me_choose_my_brand_name_and_website_domain/,"TL;DR  
adsimpler (dot com)

vs

adsimple (dot co)

\---

I'm a marketing guy who designs, publishes, and analyzes thousands of ads every year. I've been doing it for 5 years now, and I've tried almost every SaaS available to help with that process.

However, every single one of them had cut corners that didn't make sense, and I'm now tired of it.

In the past year, I started to create my own tools and automations to accelerate my workflow, and I noticed a significant improvement. So, I thought, why not put all that into a simple web app?

The first solution it would offer is a swipe file of hundreds of handpicked winning ad creatives, with ready-to-go templates. This would allow small and large businesses to reuse proven winning ads from big brands and adapt them to their brand using their favorite design tool (Figma or Canva).

Many more features would be added after launching, all of which would make advertising easier (and faster).

Since this business would ""live"" on the web, I thought that I would search for names by looking at the domain availability first.

That's where the decision comes in:

I managed to get adsimple (dot co), but then realized adsimpler (dot com) was available.

The goal is to make advertising simple, so I guess they both make sense. With that being said, English isn't my first language, so I would love to get others' feedback on how they see (and read) it.

Thanks!"
10,Day 6/50: Built a WhatsApp AI Assistant That Never Sleeps (Unlike Me on Weekends),r/automation,akhilpanja,4,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1lt8j99/day_650_built_a_whatsapp_ai_assistant_that_never/,"Spent my Sunday building something that works while I sleep - an AI-powered WhatsApp assistant that qualifies leads and responds intelligently.

The Challenge

Small businesses lose leads due to delayed responses. Studies show 78% of customers buy from the company that responds first. But who can respond at 2 AM?

10,I built an AI automation that scrapes my competitor's product reviews and social media comments (n8n + MCP + AI) - Here's everything,r/automation,astronaut_611,34,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1lsspv8/i_built_an_ai_automation_that_scrapes_my/,"I've been a marketer for last 5 years, and for over an year I used to spend 9+ hrs/wk manually creating a report on my competitors and their SKUs. I had to scroll through hundreds of Amazon reviews and Instagram comments. It's slow, tedious, and you always miss things.

AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude can't do this, they hit a wall on protected pages. So, I built a fully automated system using n8n that can.

This agent can:

* Scrape reviews for any Amazon product and give a summarised version or complete text of the reviews.
* Analyse the comments on Instagram post to gauge sentiment.
* Track pricing data, scrape regional news, and a lot more.

This system now tracks over 500,000 data points across amazon pages and social accounts for my company, and it helped us improve our messaging on ad pages and amazon listings.

**The stack:**

* **Agent:** Self-hosted n8n instance on Render (I literally found the easiest way to set this up, I have covered it in the video below)
* **Scraping:** Bright Data's Web Unlocker API, which handles proxies, and CAPTCHAs. I connected it via a Smithery MCP server, which makes it dead simple to use.
* **AI Brain:** OpenAI GPT-4o mini, to understand requests and summarize the scraped data.
* **Data Storage:** A free Supabase project to store all the outputs.

As I mentioned before, I'm a marketer (turned founder) so all of it is built without writing any code

📺 **I created a video tutorial that shows you exactly how to build this from scratc**h

It covers everything from setting up the self-hosted n8n instance to connecting the Bright Data API and saving the data in Supabase

**Watch the full video here:** [**https://youtu.be/oAXmE0\_rxSk**](https://youtu.be/oAXmE0_rxSk)

Here are all the key steps in the process:

**Step 1: Host n8n on Render**

* **Fork Render’s n8n blueprint** → [https://render.com/docs/deploy-n8n](https://render.com/docs/deploy-n8n)
* In Render → **Blueprints ▸ New Blueprint Instance ▸ Connect** the repo you just created.

**Step 2: Install the MCP community node**

* Link to the community node -&gt; [https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-mcp?utm\_source=chatgpt.co](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[m](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Step 6: Make a project on Supabase**

* Setup a free account on [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/)

**Step 7: Connect the Supabase project to the workflow**

* Connect your Supabase project to the ai agent
* Back in Supabase **Table Editor**, create `scraping_data` with columns:
   * `id` (UUID, PK, default = `uuid_generate_v4()`)
   * `created_at` (timestamp, default = `now()`)
   * `output` (text)
* Map the **output** field from the AI agent into the `output` column.

**Step 8: Build further**

* **Webhook trigger:** Swap `On Chat Message` for `Webhook` to call the agent from any app or Lovable/Bolt front-end.
* **Cron jobs:** Add a **Schedule** node (e.g., daily at 05:00) to track prices, follower counts, or news.

Lately I’ve been trying to audit how I spend my time—and it’s honestly shocking how much of it still goes to small, repetitive tasks. Copying data between tools, renaming files, organizing notes, setting up recurring meetings... It all adds up and feels like it’s eating into my actual *productive* hours.

It got me thinking: what tasks have you fully or partially automated that had the biggest impact on your daily efficiency? 

Whether it’s using AI, Zapier-style no-code automations, or even some clever use of scripts, I’d love to hear what’s working for you. I'm especially interested in things that removed friction from your workflow—not just saving time, but reducing mental load too.

Personally, I'm still doing way too much manually when it comes to file management and cross-tool updates. I’m pretty sure there’s a better way, and I’m probably just not using the right tools yet.

&gt;Also curious—how do you usually *find* new automation ideas? Do you follow certain YouTubers, blogs, or subreddits that help you stay ahead of the curve?

Looking forward to learning from what’s worked for you. Hoping to build out a smarter, more streamlined workflow without overcomplicating things. Thanks in advance!"

9,50k Followers on Instagram in 2 years - Update,r/startup,Slow_Trash_3204,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startup/comments/1lt6785/50k_followers_on_instagram_in_2_years_update/,"**Hey guys**,

Few months ago I was struggling to get more business.

I read hundreds of blogs and watched hundreds of youtube videos and tried to use their strategy but failed.

When someone did respond, they'd be like: How does this help?

After tweaking what gurus taught me, I made my own content strategy that gets me business on demand.

I recently joined back this community and I see dozens of posts and comments here having issues scaling/marketing.

So I hope this helps a couple of you get more business.

I invested a lot of time and effort into Instagram content marketing, and with consistent posting, l've been able to grow our following by 50x in the last 20 months (700 to 35k), and while growing this following, we got hundreds of leads and now we are insanely profitable.

As of today, approximately 70% of our monthly revenue comes from Instagram.

I have now fully automated my instagram content marketing by hiring virtual assistants. I regret not hiring VAs early, I now have 4 VAs and the quality of work they provide for the price is just mind blowing.

If you are struggling, this guide can give you some insights.

**Pros**: Can be done for SO investment if you do it by yourself, can bring thousands of leads, appointments, sales and revenue and puts you on active founder mode.

**Cons**: Requires you to be very consistent and need to put in some time investment.

**Hiring VAs:** Hiring a VA can be tricky, they can either be the best asset or a huge liability. I've tried Fiverr, Upwork, agencies and Offshore Wolf, I currently have 4 VAs with [u/offshorewolf](/user/offshorewolf/) as they provide full time assistants for just $99/Week, these VAs are very hard working and the quality of the work is unmatchable.

I'll start with the Instagram algorithm to begin with and then I'll get to posting tips.

You need to know these things before you post:

**Instagram Algorithm**

Like every single platform on the web, Instagram wants to show it's visitors the highest quality content in the visitor's niche inside their platform. Also, these platforms want to keep the visitors inside their platform. Also, these platforms want to keep the visitors inside their platform for as long as possible.

From my 20 month analysis, I noticed **4 content stages** :

**#1 The first 100 minutes of your content**

**Stage 1:** Every single time you make a post, Instagram's algorithm scores your content, their goal is to determine if your content is a low or a high quality post.

**Stage 2:** If the algorithm detects your content as a high quality post, it appears in your follower's feed for a short period of time. Meanwhile, different algorithms observe how your followed are reacting to your content.

**Stage 3:** If your followers liked, commented, shared and massively engaged in your content, Instagram now takes your content to the next level.

**Stage 4:** At this pre-viral stage, again the algorithms review your content to see if there's anything against their TOS, it will check why your post is performing exceptionally well compared to other content, and checks whether there's something spammy.

If there's no any red flags in your content, eg, Spam, the algorithm keeps showing your post to your look-alike audience for the next 24-48 hours (this is what we observed) and after the 48 hour period, the engagement drops by 99%. (You can also join Instagram engagement communities and pods to increase your engagement)

**#2: Posting at the right time is very very very very important**

As you probably see by now, more engagement in first phase = more chance your content explodes. So, it's important to post content when your current audience is most likely to engage.

Even if you have a world-class winning content, if you post while ghosts are having lunch, the chances of your post performing well is slim to none.

In this age, tricking the algorithm while adding massive value to the platform will always be a recipe that'll help your content to explode.

According to a report posted by a popular social media management platform:

\*The best time to post on Instagram is 7:45 AM, 10:45 AM, 12:45 PM and 5:45 PM in your local time. \*The best days for B2B companies to post on Instagram are Wednesday followed by Tuesday. \*The best days for B2C companies to post on Instagram are Monday and Wednesday.

These numbers are backed by data from millions of accounts, but every audience and every market is different. so If it's not working for you, stop, A/B test and double down on what works.

**#3 Don't ever include a link in your post.**

What happens if you add a foreign link to your post? Visitors click on it and switch platform. Instagram hates this, every content platform hates it. Be it reddit, facebook, linkedin or instagram.

They will penalize you for adding links. How will they penalize?

They will show it to less people = Less engagement = Less chance of your post going viral

But there's a way to add links, its by adding the link in the comment 2-5 mins after your initial post which tricks the algorithm.

Okay, now the content tips:

**#1. Always write in a conversational rhythm and a human tone.**

It's 2025, anyone can GPT a prompt and create content, but still we can easily know if it's written by a human or a GPT, if your content looks like it's made using Al, the chances of it going viral is slim to none.

Also, people on Instagram are pretty informal and are not wearing serious faces like Linkedin, they are loose and like to read in a conversational tone.

Understand the consonance between long and short sentences, and write like you're writing a friend.

**#2 Try to use simple words as much as possible**

Big words make no sense in 2025. Gone are the days of 'guru' words like blueprint, secret sauce, Inner circle, Insider, Mastery and Roadmap.

There's dozens more I'd love to add, you know it.

Avoid them and use simple words as much as possible.

Guru words will annoy your readers and makes your post look fishy.

So be simple and write in a clear tone, our brain is designed to preserve energy for future use.

As a result, it choses the easier option.

So, Never **utilize** when you can **use** or **Purchase** when you can **buy** or **Initiate** when you can **start**.

Simple words win every single time.

Plus, there's a good chance 5-10% of your audience is non-native english speaker. So be simple if you want to get more engagement.

**#3 Use spaces as much as possible.**

Long posts are scary, boring and drifts away eyes of your viewers. No one wants to read something that's long, boring and time consuming. People on Instagram are skimming content to pass their time. If your post looks like an essay, they'll scroll past without a second thought. Keep it short, punchy, and to the point. Use simple words, break up text, and get straight to the value. The faster they get it, the more likely they'll engage. **If your post looks like this no one will read it, you get the point**.

**#4 Start your post with a hook**

On Instagram, the very first picture is your headline. It's the first thing your audience sees, if it looks like a 5 year old's work, your audience will scroll down in 2 seconds.

So your opening image is very important, it should trigger the reader and make them swipe and read more.

**#5 Do not use emojis everywhere**

That's just another sign of 'guru syndrome.'

Only gurus use emojis everywhere Because they want to sell you They want to pitch you They want you to buy their $1499 course

It's 2025, it simply doesn't work.

Only use when it's absolutely iMportant.

**#6 Add related hashtags in comments and tag people.**

When you add hashtags, you tell the algorithm that the #hashtag is relevant to that topic and when you tag people, their followers become the lookalike audience, the platform will show to their followers when your post goes viral.

**#7 Use every trick to make people comment**

It's different for everyone but if your audience engages in your post and makes a comment, the algorithm knows it's a value post.

We generated 700 signups and got hundreds of new business with this simple strategy.

Here's how it works:

You will create a lead magnet that your audience loves (ebook, guides, blog post etc.) that solves their problem.

And you'll launch it on Instagram. **Then, follow these steps**:

**Step 1**: Create a post and lock your lead magnet. (VSL works better)

**Step 2**: To unlock and get the post, they simply have to comment. 

**Step 3**: Scrape their comments using dataminer. 

**Step 4**: Send automated dms to commentators and ask for an email to send the ebook.

You'll be surprised how well this works.

 **#8 Get personal**

Instagram is a very personal platform, people share the dinners that their husbands took them to, they share their pets doing funny things, and post about their daily struggles and wins. If your content feels like a corporate ad, people will ignore it.

So be one of them and share what they want to see, what they want to hear and what they find value in.

**#9 Plant your seeds with every single content**

An average customer makes a purchase decision after seeing your product or service for at least 3 times. You need to warm up your customer with engaging content repeatedly which will nurture them to eventually make a purchase decision.

**# Be Authentic**

Whether that be in your bio, your website copy, or Instagram posts, it's easy to fake things in this age, so being authentic always wins.

The internet is a small place, and people talk. If potential clients sense even a hint of dishonesty, it can destroy your credibility and trust before you even get a chance to prove yourself.

That's it for today guys, let me know if you want a part 2, I can continue this in more detail."
9,marketing update: 9 tactics that helped us get more clients and 5 that didn't,r/startup,goudgirls,6,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/startup/comments/1lszu7z/marketing_update_9_tactics_that_helped_us_get/,"About a year ago, my boss suggested that we concentrate our B2B marketing efforts on LinkedIn.

We achieved some solid results that have made both LinkedIn our obvious choice to get clients compared to the old-fashioned blogs/email newsletters.

Here's what worked and what didn't for us. I also want to hear what has worked and what hasn't for you guys.

# 1. Building CEO's profile instead of the brand's, WORKS

I noticed that many company pages on LinkedIn with tens of thousands of followers get only a few likes on their posts. At the same time, some ordinary guy from Mississippi with only a thousand followers gets ten times higher engagement rate.

This makes sense: social media is about people, not brands. So from day one, I decided to focus on growing the CEO/founder's profile instead of the company's. This was the right choice, within a very short time, we saw dozens of likes and thousands of views on his updates.

# 2. Turning our sales offer into a no brainer, WORKS LIKE HELL

At u/offshorewolf, we used to pitch our services like everyone else: “We offer virtual assistants, here's what they do, let’s hop on a call.” But in crowded markets, clarity kills confusion and confusion kills conversions.

So we did one thing that changed everything: we productized our offer into a dead-simple pitch.

**“Hire a full-time offshore employee for $99/week.”**

That’s it. No fluff, no 10-page brochures. Just one irresistible offer that practically sells itself.

By framing the service as a product with a fixed outcome and price, we removed the biggest friction in B2B sales: decision fatigue. People didn’t have to *think*, they just *booked a call*.

This move alone cut our sales cycle in half and added consistent weekly revenue without chasing leads.

If you're in B2B and struggling to convert traffic into clients, try turning your service into a flat-rate product with one-line clarity. It worked for us, *massively*.

# 3. Growing your network through professional groups, WORKS

A year ago, the CEO had a network that was pretty random and outdated. So under his account, I joined a few groups of professionals and started sending out invitations to connect.

Every day, I would go through the list of the group's members and add 10-20 new contacts. This was bothersome, but necessary at the beginning. Soon, LinkedIn and Facebook started suggesting relevant contacts by themselves, and I could opt out of this practice.

# 4. Sending out personal invites, WORKS! (kind of)

LinkedIn encourages its users to send personal notes with invitations to connect. I tried doing that, but soon found this practice too time-consuming. As a founder of 200-million fast-growing brand, the CEO already saw a pretty impressive response rate. I suppose many people added him to their network hoping to land a job one day.

What I found more practical in the end was sending a personal message to the most promising contacts AFTER they have agreed to connect. This way I could be sure that our efforts weren't in vain. People we reached out personally tended to become more engaged. I also suspect that when it comes to your feed, LinkedIn and Facebook prioritize updates from contacts you talked to.

# 5. Keeping the account authentic, WORKS

I believe in authenticity: it is crucial on social media. So from the get-go, we decided not to write anything FOR the CEO. He is pretty active on other platforms where he writes in his native language.

We pick his best content, adapt it to the global audience, translate in English and publish. I can't prove it, but I'm sure this approach contributed greatly to the increase of engagement on his LinkedIn and Facebook accounts. People see that his stuff is real.

# 6. Using the CEO account to promote other accounts, WORKS

The problem with this approach is that I can't manage my boss. If he is swamped or just doesn't feel like writing, we have zero content, and zero reach. Luckily, we can still use his ""likes.""

Today, LinkedIn and Facebook are unique platforms, like Facebook in its early years. When somebody in your network likes a post, you see this post in your feed even if you aren't connected with its author.

So we started producing content for our top managers and saw almost the same engagement as with the CEO's own posts because we could reach the entire CEO's network through his ""likes"" on their posts!

# 7. Publishing video content, DOESN'T WORK

I read million times that video content is killing it on social media and every brand should incorporate videos in its content strategy. We tried various types of video posts but rarely managed to achieve satisfying results.

With some posts our reach was higher than the average but still, it couldn't justify the effort (making even home-made-style videos is much more time-consuming than writings posts).

# 8. Leveraging slideshows, WORKS (like hell)

We found the best performing type of content almost by accident. As many companies do, we make lots of slideshows, and some of them are pretty decent, with tons of data, graphs, quotes, and nice images. Once, we posted one of such slideshow as PDF, and its reach **skyrocketed!**

It wasn't actually an accident, every time we posted a slideshow the results were much better than our average reach. We even started creating slideshows specifically for LinkedIn and Facebook, with bigger fonts so users could read the presentation right in the feed, without downloading it or making it full-screen.

# 9. Adding links to the slideshows, DOESN'T WORK

I tried to push the slideshow thing even further and started adding links to our presentations. My thinking was that somebody do prefer to download and see them as PDFs, in this case, links would be clickable. Also, I made shortened urls, so they were fairly easy to be typed in.

Nobody used these urls in reality.

# 10. Driving traffic to a webpage, DOESN'T WORK

Every day I see people who just post links on LinkedIn and Facebook and hope that it would drive traffic to their websites. I doubt it works. Any social network punishes those users who try to lure people out of the platform. Posts with links will never perform nearly as well as posts without them.

I tried different ways of adding links, as a shortlink, natively, in comments... It didn't make any difference and I couldn't turn LinkedIn or Facebook into a decent source of traffic for our own webpages.

On top of how algorithms work, I do think that people simply don't want to click on anything in general, they WANT to stay on the platform.

# 11. Publishing content as LinkedIn articles, DOESN'T WORK

LinkedIn limits the size of text you can publish as a general update. Everything that exceeds the limit of 1300 characters should be posted as an ""article.""

I expected the network to promote this type of content (since you put so much effort into writing a long-form post). In reality articles tended to have as bad a reach/engagement as posts with external links. So we stopped publishing any content in the form of articles.

It's better to keep updates under the 1300 character limit. When it's not possible, adding links makes more sense, at least you'll drive some traffic to your website. Yes, I saw articles with lots of likes/comments but couldn't figure out how some people managed to achieve such results.

# 12. Growing your network through your network, WORKS

When you secure a certain level of reach, you can start expanding your network ""organically"", through your existing network. Every day I go through the likes and comments on our updates and send invitations to the people who are:

from the CEO's 2nd/3rd circle and

fit our target audience.

Since they just engaged with our content, the chances that they'll respond to an invite from the CEO are pretty high. Every day, I also review new connections, pick the most promising person (CEOs/founders/consultants) and go through their network to send new invites. LinkedIn even allows you to filter contacts so, for example, you can see people from a certain country (which is quite handy).

# 13. Leveraging hashtags, DOESN'T WORK (atleast for us)

Now and then, I see posts on LinkedIn overstuffed with hashtags and can't wrap my head around why people do that. So many hashtags decrease readability and also look like a desperate cry for attention. And most importantly, they simply don't make that much difference.

I checked all the relevant hashtags in our field and they have only a few hundred followers, sometimes no more than 100 or 200. I still add one or two hashtags to a post occasionally hoping that at some point they might start working.

For now, LinkedIn and Facebook aren't Instagram when it comes to hashtags.

# 14. Creating branded hashtags, WORKS (or at least makes sense)

What makes more sense today is to create a few branded hashtags that will allow your followers to see related updates. For example, we've been working on a venture in China, and I add a special hashtag to every post covering this topic.

Thanks for reading.

As of now, the CEO has around 2,500 followers. You might say the number is not that impressive, but I prefer to keep the circle small and engaged. Every follower who sees your update and doesn't engage with it reduces its chances to reach a wider audience. Becoming an account with tens of thousands of connections and a few likes on updates would be sad.

We're in B2B, and here the quality of your contacts matters as much as the quantity. So among these 2,5000 followers, there are lots of CEOs/founders. And now our organic reach on LinkedIn and Facebook varies from 5,000 to 20,000 views a week. We also receive 25–100 likes on every post. There are lots of people on LinkedIn and Facebook who post constantly but have much more modest numbers.

We also had a few posts with tens of thousands views, but never managed to rank as the most trending posts. This is the area I want to investigate. The question is how to pull this off staying true to ourselves and to avoid producing that cheesy content I usually see trending."
9,I Launched 39 Startups Until One Made Me Millions. This Is What I Wish I Knew.,r/startup,EmilianoLGU,145,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/startup/comments/1lshncf/i_launched_39_startups_until_one_made_me_millions/,"**Most “founders” never launch anything.** 

They build a project for months, never complete it and eventually scrap the product. Or launch it and get no customers.

**Startups are truthfully a numbers game.** Even the best founders have hit rates under 10%. Just look at founders like Peter Levels.

So how do you maximize your chances of success, the honest answer is to increase the number of startups you launch.

I’m going to get hate for this: but you should NOT spend hundreds of hours building a product… until you know for certain that there is demand.

You should launch with just a landing page.

Write a one pager on what you will build, and use a completely free UI library like Magic UI to build a landing page.

It should take you under a day.

Then what do you do?

Add a stripe checkout button and/or a book a demo button.

And then launch. Post everywhere about it(Reddit, X, LinkedIn, etc) and message anyone  on the internet who has ever mentioned having the problem you are solving.

Launch and dedicate yourself to marketing and sales for 1 week straight.

If you can’t get signups or demo requests within 1 week of marketing it 24/7... KILL IT and START OVER.

Most “startups” are not winners. And there are only THREE reasons why someone will not pay you, either:

1. They don’t actually have the problem.
2. They aren’t willing to pay to solve the problem.
3. They don’t think your product is good enough to try and pay for.

If people do sign up and check out with a stripe link you simply come clean with a paraphrased version of:

“I actually haven’t finished the product yet, but I’d love to talk to you about the problem you’re facing. I put a sign up link on the website to see if anyone would actually care about my product enough to pay for it”

Then you refund the customer.

**This is where I’m going to get hate:**

1. It is not unethical to advertise a product you have not finished building.
2. It is not unethical to put a checkout link and collect payments for an unfinished product to test demand… as long as you simply refund “customers”.

When you do eventually get sign ups or demo requests, the demand is proven. Only then do you invest 2 weeks in building a real product.

Do not waste hundreds of hours of your valuable time building products no one cares about.

Test demand with a landing page and check out link/demo request link.

If demand is proven: build it.

If demand isn’t proven: start over with a new idea.

Repeat.

You will get a hit if you do this… eventually.

This is personally how I tested 39 different startups… and killed 37 of them with little to no revenue to show for it.

For context: Of the 2 startups that DID get traction from this strategy:

1. One went on to hit $50M+ in GMV
2. [Rivin.ai](http://rivin.ai/) went on to raise an investment from Jason Calacanis and works with multi-billion dollar e-commerce brands to analyze Walmart sales data.

Stop wasting your time building products no one cares about. Validate. Build. Sell. Repeat."
9,LinkedIn / Apollo Scraper + Outreach Automation,r/automation,ChaseAI,28,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1lt6ish/linkedin_apollo_scraper_outreach_automation/,"This automation conducts the entire cold outreach pipeline from lead discovery to email campaign setup, all while creating custom outreach messaging for each individual lead.

Big picture, this workflow scrapes lead's information from Apollo via Apify, conducts research on the lead's company via Tavily, creates custom messaging for each lead by combining that scraped information with your personal value proposition, then uploads all the relevant information (messaging, lead info, emails) to [Instantly.ai](http://instantly.ai/) to conduct a full scale email campaign. The user simple fills out a form stating what sort of lead they are after (job title, location, company size, and keywords).

I've created multiple variations of this workflow in the past with direct LinkedIn scraping being conducted via Apify but I've found using Apollo to grab what is ultimately the same LinkedIn information tends to work out much better-- especially when it comes to finding valid emails.

Cost to run this isn't cheap but it also isn't prohibitively expensive. Individual costs are shown in the image but this can be scaled to thousands of emails without breaking the bank.

Instantly has a pretty robust email campaign system so you're all set when it comes to warming up accounts and having a one stop shop for monitoring the campaign progress.

Lastly, when it comes to areas of improvement, I would move away for Google Sheets in favor of something more flexible. You could also argue the integration of some sort of email validator would be nice but I've found Apollo to be pretty reliable on that front.

9,We All Should Stop Min-Maxing Our Lives,r/productivity,ExtraMap1098,175,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1lt6077/we_all_should_stop_minmaxing_our_lives/,"This is a thought that has been floating in my head for quite a while, but I think we, as a society, should strive to stop min-maxing and incorporate more whimsy in our lives.

Why do we need to optimize everything? Why do we need to eliminate every distractions? Why can't we just live life as it is, flaws and all?

I min-maxed my entire life. I pride myself in my productivity and my achievements. I have very little social media presence. And it only left me wondering, is this all what life has to offer? Being a productivity machine and making money? Where is the fulfilment in that?

I can't enjoy the small things, because my brain keeps thinking about the future and what to optimize next. I can't enjoy the present because I am fixated on my goals. For others this is what you strive for, but let me tell you -- this sucks. This is not living. This is just existing.

I am always reminded of what Sam Altman said, ""Adjusted for the subjective increase in how time passes, life is half over by 23 or 24."" This is very true. Min-maxing life makes time passes faster. You are esentially also wasting time, just in a more societally acceptable way.

Sorry for the messy post. It is past midnight and I just want to put this thought out there. I strongly believe that one should not strive to be the most productive they could be. Don't try to optimize everything. Your life is more worthwhile than that.

I also recognize that this comes from a very privileged viewpoint. I do live a comfortable lifestyle that allows for a margin of error. Others may not. This is obviously not a clear-cut issue, but a conversation about this is gravely needed. "

This is now the 5th client where I missed a deadline. Most of them started as small projects (like $100–$200), but the work always expands — feedback turns into full rewrites, or I procrastinate too long, then rush, feel overwhelmed, and eventually miss the deadline entirely.

Latest case: I delivered, then got feedback that completely changed the project. I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.

I hate this pattern. It feels like I’m burning bridges one by one, and every time I tell myself ""next time I’ll be better,"" but then… same thing.

I don’t think I’m lazy. When I do work, I can focus for hours and I really care about the quality. But it’s like the pressure builds up, and instead of acting, I freeze. Or waste time on YouTube, telling myself I’ll start soon — until it’s too late.

I am a partner of a small MEP engineering firm (8 employees). We have been growing quickly so are now looking for some project management software to help us manage employees and track deadlines. We currently just use Excel and it's becoming cumbersome to manage with really no automation to help our team keep track of workload. We want something really simple, with the following features:

* List all active projects and the status of the projects
* Show dates for all major milestones and submissions
* Assign team members to those projects so they can be notified when they are assigned a project
* Outlook calendar integration so they get invites to their calendars when deadlines are added or updated
* We do not want anything with detailed task tracking. We are not trying to micromanage certain tasks, just have a master list of projects and deadlines with team members assigned to those deadline.
* Break down workload per employee so management can track how many projects are assigned to each team member

9,Airport incident: a family accidentally broke a tester perfume at Tom Ford. Retail staff resorted to intimidation and demanded the family to pay up. What should have been done?,r/retail,TypicalElk13,76,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/retail/comments/1ltbse6/airport_incident_a_family_accidentally_broke_a/,"Hi Reddit,
I just landed home from a flight and was thinking about an episode that occured at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) while I was there. 

In summary: An Indian family, who couldn't communicate in English, had accidentally broken a tester perfume at Tom Ford. The retail staff was incredibly rude and demanded the family to pay for the whole thing. I intervened (since I fluently speak English + Urdu — a language very similar to the Indian Hindi). Initially, I just wanted to serve as a translator but seeing how nervous and panicked the family was, I took over as their representative entirely. The retail staff said that they would bring over the police and they would take the family away if they hadn't paid. I'm educated enough to know that can NEVER happen, especially when the family was calm and cooperative. I very politely and respectfully led the discourse, argued reasonably (i.e., testers have to be replaced regardless, big brands have insurance for these things, it would have been cut off in general damages regardless, police are only involved if you break a law and ain't no law out there that criminalises a petty accident). My tone was polite, respectful and civil. I was talking with a smile and my head slightly bowed to cite shame. I apologised on behalf of the Indian family multiple times. But the staff remained hostile and their tone was both loud and demeaning. Eventually, I negotiated for over an hour and they coerced the family into purchasing a cheaper lipstick (which was still $57). I, personally, was attempting to resolve the situation in a way where the family isn't made to pay anything (you could tell that they belonged to a struggling class). I am also aware that, in most cases, companies (as massive as TF) let such things go. I did my best to negotiate but now that I am researching the topic well, I am coming across similar situations where most people weren't made to pay anything at all. The only reason I surrendered during the situation was that both the family and I had poor passports and belonged to the developing part of the world (much of the situation had undertones of prejudice). We both had flights to catch in a few hours and couldn't afford a serious escalation. I was also anxious because I feared a situation where the staff made a false accusation and a real investigation was prompted. Regardless, I can't help but think I could have done something more or something better.

What would have been an ideal way of handling this situation? 

(Also, when the retail staff became loud and aggressive with me, I told them I would record the situation to which they said that recording people on an airport is not allowed. Just here to ask that how much of the bs that the retail staff said was actually true?) "

9,South African healthcare system just killed my friend.,r/digitalnomad,747WakeTurbulance,887,155,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1lu14u3/south_african_healthcare_system_just_killed_my/,"My best friend was on a photo safari in South Africa last month when he suffered a heart attack. He was deep in the bush and urgently needed to be medevacked to a hospital by helicopter.

He could easily afford any care required. But the emergency services told him they did not take credit cards — the money had to be wired to their bank account before they would dispatch a helicopter.

At 4 a.m. local time, his wife was desperately calling family back home, asking them to be at the bank when it opened at 9 a.m. to arrange the transfer. By 10 a.m., the tens of thousands of dollars demanded had been wired.

And then they waited. It took another three hours for the helicopter to be dispatched and to finally reach him. When he was flown to the cardiology facility, the hospital refused to evaluate or treat him until a second wire transfer was completed. His wife had the family rush back to the bank to send more money.

Only then, hours later, did they bring in a heart specialist. After running tests, they confirmed he needed a stent. He was prepped and taken to surgery. About an hour later, a man who called himself the doctor came out and said the surgery had been successful, but that my friend had died afterward and that ""there was nothing they could have done.""

There was no compassion, no grief counseling, just cold information and a number to a funeral home that she could work with to get the body back - for an additional wire.

She was completely alone for two days until her son was able to reach her. It then took two full weeks for the body to be released and transported back to the U.S.

My friend was a good man. A pillar of our community. He volunteered his construction services for people in need. He lived honestly and generously. He did not deserve to be treated this way. He could have paid for everything upfront without hesitation. But the South African health care system refused to act until they had their money in the bank. Those 18 lost hours in getting the money transferred cost him his life. He was only 60 years old.

Yes, he had travel insurance. But that meant nothing. Travel insurance reimburses you — it doesn’t pay upfront. In South Africa, if you’re a foreigner, you must have cash in their bank before they will do anything.

The funeral was yesterday. And I will never forgive them for what they did."

I have been testing it with a few friends who want to use it to rename and sort their files based on their content and fill out template documents using information from other documents (essentially lots of copying and pasting). But I'm keen to learn about more real-world workflows and understand what people want to automate.

In case it's helpful, here are some questions I have in mind:

1. What is your business and your day-to-day like?
2. When was the last time you had to do boring, repetitive work, especially something you wish to automate? What was the task?

4. What happens if you stop doing that work?
5. What tasks have you automated, and how?

Not great, but I get it.

The problem though is that I've been setting up separate accounts for different side projects. The obvious move for me would be to consolidate all of those into a single paid 'Business' account.

However, I just discovered there's literally no way to do this. You can't merge accounts. You can't even migrate a single website from one account to another.

So my options are basically:

1. Nuke all my historical data and start every property from scratch in a new account and spending a solid week manually rebuilding every single report, goal, and Tag Manager container.
2. Pay for multiple, separate Business plans for all eternity, which makes no financial sense.

For a data analytics company, telling users that the only upgrade path involves either deleting their data and having an insane amount of manual labor feels or suddenly pay thousands of dollars a year is ... wild.

I've put a feature request on their forum, but honestly, I am wondering if this might be even on purpose to force as many upgrades as possible (even if it makes a lot of people lose their data). Wondering what anyone else in this spot is planning to do?

**TL;DR:** Piwik PRO is making free users upgrade, but offers no tool to merge multiple free accounts into one paid account. You  lose all your historical data and need to rebuild everything manually."

Like most teams, we started with Twilio. It worked well at first, but we started running into issues as we scaled.

Here’s a breakdown of what made us switch and how Messente has held up after 100,000+ messages.

# Why we moved away from Twilio

* Pricing started getting unpredictable once we scaled  
* Delivery rates dropped in some markets, especially in Asia  
* Reporting was too basic for our compliance needs  
* Support wasn’t responsive when we had urgent delivery issues  

# Why we tried Messente

Someone from a logistics company recommended it for international delivery. I hadn’t heard of them before, but the platform promised better delivery reliability, more transparent reporting, and support for both SMS and Viber fallback, which sounded useful for some of our markets.

# What we found

**Reporting**

Twilio’s reporting was fine for basic use cases, but Messente gave us full delivery logs, timestamps, and error codes we could actually act on.

**Dashboard**

Messente’s UI is way more focused. No bloat. Everything is where it should be.

**Support**

When we ran into questions during implementation, their team got back to us within a few hours. One time they even helped troubleshoot carrier filtering in real time.

**Global delivery**

This was the biggest difference. Delivery rates improved immediately in countries where we previously had trouble. We suspect it’s due to direct carrier routes, but either way, it worked.

**API**

Very straightforward. I’d say just as easy to implement as Twilio’s."
8,Managing 10+ WhatsApp numbers manually was chaos — here’s how we fixed it with HubSpot,r/CRM,sara733,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRM/comments/1lu3mnz/managing_10_whatsapp_numbers_manually_was_chaos/,"Hey folks,
We handle a high volume of WhatsApp messages — more than *10 different numbers* across sales and support. Back in the day, we used to manage everything manually, and yeah… it was messy.

We had to log chats manually into *HubSpot*, assign them to agents, follow up later (often too late), and things would get even worse during peak season. Some leads got lost, replies overlapped, and team coordination was all over the place.

At some point, we started looking for a proper solution to bring WhatsApp into our CRM without a bunch of workarounds.

Funny enough, we found a workaround using *Zapier* to automate some WhatsApp tasks and while it helped a bit, it still felt clunky and disconnected overall.

Then I noticed *TimelinesAI has a native HubSpot integration* in the marketplace. And honestly, that changed everything. Once we connected our numbers, messages started syncing directly to HubSpot. No Zapier needed anymore. 

If you’re using other CRMs (for most known CRMs they have native integration), however if you use some simple CRMs you can still use TimelinesAI with Zapier or Make for custom automations. They have different plans depending on what you need.

*What I Like About TimelinesAI*

▪️ Handles multiple WhatsApp numbers in a single inbox

▪️ HubSpot integration is super smooth — no manual copy-paste anymore

▪️ Agents can collaborate on chats without overlapping

▪️ Works with both Zapier and Make

▪️ Support replies fast and actually helps

▪️ It’s stable and just works once it’s set up


*What Could Be Better*

▪️ Doesn’t support e-commerce tools like Shopify

▪️ UI isn’t the prettiest, but it gets the job done



If anything breaks or we run into issues, I’ll update here. But for now, it’s been saving us hours every week."
7,"If you’ve ever said “It’s just faster if I do it myself,” read this.",r/Entrepreneur,The-Business-Guru,110,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1lu4v1w/if_youve_ever_said_its_just_faster_if_i_do_it/,"I’ve worked with a lot of founders and operators, and this is the most common bottleneck I see. ***It feels faster to do it yourself.*** You know how you want it done, and explaining it sounds like more work than just getting it done.

But that mindset is exactly what keeps businesses stuck. You don’t scale by doing everything yourself. You scale by building systems other people can run.

I often tell my clients they need to shift from RUNNING a business to BUILDING a business. Those are different muscles to flex in a business.

If you’re in this trap, here are five ops tips that help get you out of the weeds:

1. **Document it once, delegate it forever** If you’ve done a task more than twice, record a Loom and write a quick step-by-step. Done is better than perfect.
2. **Use a task manager, not your memory** Your brain should focus on decisions, not reminders. Use ClickUp, Notion, Asana, or even a sticky note system. Just pick one and stick with it.
3. **Set default decisions** Take away decision fatigue. Example: invoices go out on Fridays, client emails get answered at 10 and 3. The more defaults, the faster your day moves.
4. **Hire for outcomes, not hours** Don’t pay someone to “help.” Define what success looks like, hand it off, and let them own it.
5. **Build for the team you don’t have yet** If the business only works when you’re touching everything, you don’t have a business. You have a job with a fancy title. Build it so someone else could run it tomorrow.

What’s one system or change that helped you step back and actually focus on growth?

Would love to hear what’s worked for others."

Happy early Independence Day if you are in the United States! May you celebrate safely and still have all of your fingers (attached) the next morning! Let's go through our Declaration of Help and see what happened here last week! 

***

**NEWS AND ISSUES**

* Thought I was going to make it through without having to report a little incident, but one snuck in on me! Yesterday, [this issue](https://old.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1lqb9c6/android_unable_to_delete_comments_version_2025250/n13dxxg/) cropped up and made it so users were having trouble deleting their comments. It's since been fixed! Shout out to everyone who reported it and also to the team that got it fixed up so fast! 

* There is a new Changelog out! I posted about this in r/help [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1lp7ood/new_changelog_july_1_2025/) and crossposted over in r/bugs [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1lp7p1d/new_changelog_july_1_2025/)! You can read all about it [here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/38922264026260-Changelog-July-1-2025). The noted changes include: 

 * Being able to add a specific community name to your query to get answers from just that community when using Reddit Answers.

 * When returning to your feed from a post, the last post visited will be set to the top of your feed view. 

 * Posts about a trending story or event will be seen grouped together at the top of the popular feed for some users.

 *  Keyboard shortcuts have started to roll out to some Redditors and will be available to all in the coming weeks. 

 * Reddit Games are now in the Community drawer. (There's some great stuff in there! Shoutout to r/TypeBattle!)

 * Messages directly from Reddit will now appear as announcements in your notifications inbox.

 * Messages from good bots will now be delivered in Reddit chat instead of private messages.

 * There's more room to type in chat! 

 * And a few moderators changes as well, including the Mod Application tool being available on Android and desktop, alumni mod status, and mod visibility permissions with new profile settings! 

* There is currently an issue, as described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1ljys20/mobile_web_further_information_on_the_creating_an/?share_id=xqdbLtoTbdhiOw4HDdMyB), where you are not given the opportunity to choose a username if you create an account via SSO on the mobile site. I flagged this to the team in charge of that feature and it doesn't appear to be intentional, so that is being looked into. The workaround is to create an account from the app and that should allow you to choose a username. 

* There are experiments going on with comment insights. Recently, comment insights were available on the desktop site. That experiment has ended and they are now being tested out on Android. When that's done, iOS will get a shot of them. So if you're no longer seeing comment insights on the desktop site, that's expected at this time! 

* Snoo turned 20 last Monday! And today is the last day to submit entries for the art contest that we announced [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Snoo/comments/1liliw4/whats_snoo_20th_cakeday_contest/)! Let's see those Snoos! 

* There is no app release next week! 

***

**FRIENDLY REMINDERS**

* If you see content in r/help that breaks the rules of r/help, **please use the report button.** You do not need to engage with those users unless you're going to redirect them to where they can actually get the help that they're looking for. But regardless, **please report rule breaking content**. Reporting content that breaks the rules helps us keep r/help free of spam and off-topic posts, and that allows users who really need out help to more easily get it. 

***

**BUGS ROUND UP (THANKS, CORRECTSCALE!)**

* On Android, the links to the FAQs in subreddits are not working. They are working on iOS and on the desktop. I have flagged this to the team in charge of that feature. HUGE shout out to u/mikey_weasel and the r/newtoreddit folks for [letting me know about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1ll5m2f/weekly_recap_june_26_2025/n107mew/)! I appreciate y'all SO much! 

* [iOS] There is a [black screen when loading GIFs/videos](https://old.reddit.com/r/RedditBugs/comments/1lpq5ma/ios_black_screen_when_loading_gifs_or_videos_for/) for some users on iOS 18.6 beta, - a fix is in the works for this one, but is also resolved when updating to the second version of iOS beta 18.6 which is not yet widely available. Our fix will most likely come out first! This does only impact users on iOS beta 18.6.

* [Everything] r/all [wasn't updating for a little while](https://old.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1llq6vx/mobile_web_rall_not_updating/), but it's fixed now! 

* [iOS] [The app kept refreshing when returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1ll8sdx/ios_app_keeps_refreshing_even_with_background_app/) to the feed. This was related to an experiment that wasn't working properly and has since been fixed! 

*** 

**COMMON ACCOUNT ISSUES**

* If your account gets the ""server error"" banner or you can't update your profile, I can fix that sometimes! Just let me know and I'll take a look and get you all taken care of! (I haven't seen many of these lately, so this issue might have dwindled down to where I don't need this here, but I'll leave it up for a little while because whenever something like that gets said, it comes roaring back.) Please note that I cannot give any information or assist with any account unless contacted directly from that account. **I cannot fix accounts where you are receiving the ""server error"" message and are unable to view content from that account when logged out.** In those instances, you will need to file an appeal.

* If no one else can see your posts or comments across Reddit (not just in one sub) and you are unable to post here in r/help, you can file an appeal [here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000600232).

* Please check the [Help Center](https://www.reddithelp.com/) to see if you can find the answer to your question there. Also, check this sub for stickied posts regarding outages, major issues and downtime.

* If your account is marked as NSFW and it is not NSFW, you can check out [this Help Center article](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043471131-Why-was-my-profile-marked-as-Not-Safe-for-Work-NSFW-and-how-can-I-change-it) for information on how to change it back. If you're unable to change it back **from the desktop site**, feel free to make a post and one of the best helpers on Reddit will help me help you!

* If your account has been hacked, please write in using [this form](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000600232). Under ""What do you need assistance with?"", please choose ""Account help"". Under ""What type of account issues are occurring?"", please select ""Security problems"" and then ""I think my account has been hacked"". Then fill out the rest of the form! 

* If your account has been suspended, you can file an appeal using [this form](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000600232). Under ""What do you need assistance with?"", please choose ""Account help"". Under ""What type of account issues are occurring?"", please select ""Account status"" and then ""My account has been wrongly suspended"". Then fill out the rest of the form.

***

**WEEKLY STATISTICS**

* This week, there were 1,316 posts which is down 285 from the 1,601 posts from last week! And there were 3,260 comments and that is down 243 comments from the 3,503 comments last week. Less posts. Less comments. Makes sense!  We had our usual 1.1 million views! There were 1,600 new subscribers! Last week, there were 1,500 new subscribers. Our helpful growth continues!  

***

**HELP THAT HELPED R/HELP**

* Sometimes, you see a subreddit that you think may be breaking the Reddit Rules and want to report it. Reporting it good! We encourage reporting! When a user asked how to do this, u/westcoastcdn19 replied with [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1lok3fe/how_to_report_a_subreddit_no_working_answers_on/n0nhkcc/) that provided the link to the form that you can use to report an entire sub. And then u/thepottsy added [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1lok3fe/how_to_report_a_subreddit_no_working_answers_on/n0ni887/) about reporting a sub's moderation team. Both comments were very precise and gave the exact information that the user was looking for. Thanks to both of you for the assist with this one! 

* I know it's unthinkable, but sometimes, a user wants to delete their account! And sometimes, the link just doesn't work! Here comes u/Old_One_I with the solution! They suggested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1lpiy4g/deleting_account/n0v9muu/) that the user try deleting their account from old Reddit and provided them the direct link to do so! That saves them the trouble of hunting around and trying to figure out what that even means. Super helpful! Thank you so much! 

***

**HELP WITH R/HELP: Logging in and out**

Reddit doesn't have any rules against users having multiple accounts, even if those accounts share an email address, as long as all accounts follow the [Reddit Rules](https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules). But having multiple accounts means you may want to log in and out of them from time to time. And I see some confusion over how to do that, so let's take a minute to go over it! 

If you are logged into an account and wish to use another account, you can log out of the one account and then log into the other. 
 
To log out of an account on the app:
 
* Tap your profile icon in the upper right hand corner

* Tap your username in the middle

* Tap the right facing arrow in the box to the right of the username you want to log out of at the bottom of your screen

* Tap ""Log out""
 
To log out of an account on the desktop site, click your username in the upper right hand corner and then click “Log out” at the bottom of the drop down menu. 
 
To log into an account on the app, you can tap the + at the bottom next to “Add Account” and then enter the username and password of the account that you would like to use. 

There is not a way to switch between accounts on the desktop site like there is on the app, so if you want to use a different account, you'll need to log out of the one that you're in and then log into the one that you want to use.

7,Building a Startup Alone Is Rough — AI Tools Are Quietly Carrying Me,r/startup,JestonT,20,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/startup/comments/1loz949/building_a_startup_alone_is_rough_ai_tools_are/,"I’ve been working on my startup solo for the past few months. Full stack, marketing, ops — the whole deal. It’s exciting but also exhausting.

What’s helped me stay sane lately? Honestly… AI tools.

I’m not talking about them doing everything — I still write, test, debug, deploy — but AI has saved me in ways I didn’t expect:
* Need a fast rewrite of messy logic? Done in seconds.
* Can’t remember the right syntax for some obscure edge case? Solved.
* Need to scaffold out boilerplate code I’ve written a hundred times? Instantly handled.
* Even got help brainstorming taglines and onboarding flows when I was creatively burnt out.

It’s not perfect. I still review everything. But when you’re working 14-hour days alone, just having something that can help unblock you is… massive.

* Anyone else using AI tools as part of their startup grind?
* What are you using them for — dev, docs, marketing, bugs?
* Also curious: have they helped you launch faster, or just survive the late nights?"
7,Fundraising Is Rigged. Here's How I Beat It With No Degree And No Network To Raise Money From One Of The Top Investors Of All Time (Jason Calacanis),r/startup,EmilianoLGU,12,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/startup/comments/1lorysv/fundraising_is_rigged_heres_how_i_beat_it_with_no/,"Here’s the truth.

**Fundraising is rigged.**

If you didn’t go to Stanford or an Ivy League college, most investors simply don’t believe in you.

They’ll say they do. They’ll say they “back misfits.” But when you look at their portfolio it’s the same old story. Harvard graduate, MIT graduate, etc.

Here’s the brutal truth: VCs love to use Ivy League degrees as an IQ filter.

The typical founder? Attends a Tier 1 university and builds nothing. No product, no customers. Not even a clear idea.

Yet gets into a program like YC and gets a massive “pre-seed” investment of $500k-$2M.

Product? Idea? That comes *after* the money hits their bank account.

That’s wasn’t me. That’s not most founders, especially if you’re reading this.  
⸻

I was the Emo kid in high school blasting Kanye, skipping class, and flipping electronics online.

I never graduated college. Never worked at Google, or for anyone for that matter.

Still, I raised money from Jason Calacanis, one of the most prominent angel investors of all time (3rd/4th investor in Uber and one of the first investors in Robinhood).

Without any degree. Without any network. Without any co-founders.

**Here is how I did it.**

⸻

**Step 1: Build a Beautiful Product** 

Stop talking. Ship something real.

Your product must be:

• **Real.** Functional and live

• **Beautiful.** Polished enough to impress users

This shows investors you’re not just a talker. You are a doer who can actually build.

**Example:** I single‑handedly built Rivin.ai software for Walmart sellers and brands to analyze Walmart sales data. Before Rivin, I built software for Amazon sellers that drove $50M+ in GMV. I knew how to build a beautiful product from my last startup and used that knowledge to build the beautiful product we have today at Rivin.ai.

You don’t need a fancy resume. Or a degree. Just a beautiful product to PROVE you can build.

⸻

💵 **Step 2: Sell It (Even If It’s One Customer)**

A flawless product is meaningless if no one will pay for it.

Most engineers think “if I build a good product, they will come.”

Nope. This is not how the world works.

Look around.

If you don't see any salespeople, you're the salesperson.

You need:

• A handful of paying customers

• Clear, documented feedback

• Real revenue (not a forecast)

Within 1 week of launching Rivin.ai I had a full calendar of sales calls, a handful of Walmart sellers paying for Rivin.ai to analyze Walmart sales data, and customers giving me product feedback. They paid me. That’s traction.

⸻

**Step 3: The Secret Weapon? Pretend They’ve Already Invested**

This is the game‑changer.

The step that most founders skip: Instead of waiting to “be ready” and then *pitching*, **start by sending updates**.

Here’s how I did it:

1. Curated a list of 50+ investors I respected

2. Sent **weekly product updates** and **monthly financial snapshots**

3. Shared:

* What I built that week
* Monthly MRR, burn rate, cash on hand, and MoM growth

**Crucially: I never EVER asked for money.**  
**I just acted like they were already invested.**

👉 After a few weeks? This happened:

“Wait. Have we invested in your company? These updates are 🔥”

Exactly the reaction I wanted.

That’s how I landed Jason Calacanis’ firm to invest in Rivin.ai. There were no “VC lunches”, I never asked for money, and I don’t even think had a pitch deck.

Just undeniable traction and momentum.

That’s the secret.

⸻

💡 **Why This Works**

If you don’t have an Ivy League degree, you need to prove yourself:

1. Build = Show you can build something beautiful
2. Sell = Prove your product is needed by closing real customers
3. Update = Be disciplined and transparent

⸻

🔑 **Moral of the Story?**

**You don’t need:**

* An Ivy League degree
* A network
* Demo day
* A polished pitch deck

**You do need:**

* A working, polished product
* Real customers
* Regular, disciplined updates
* Relentless follow‑through

⸻

That was the story of how I raised initial investment for my startup Rivin.ai.

[Rivin.ai](http://Rivin.ai) builds software for Walmart sellers and is trusted by multi-billion dollar brands to power their Walmart sales data insights…. so they can make smarter inventory and purchasing decisions with Walmart data.

Hope this helps you out! Let me know if you’d like me to share my exact email templates in another post. This one is long a bit long as is haha"
7,How I automated my blog *without* complex n8n workflows,r/automation,Past_Reading8451,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1ltzqjr/how_i_automated_my_blog_without_complex_n8n/,"Tl; dr: I built my own tool to generate 200 articles with variety on a broad topic.

I’m currently building an [AI personal assistant](http://saidar.ai), and wanted to create a blog for distribution purposes. 

I looked at a few ways to automate this (n8n workflows, ChatGPT / Claude) directly, but none worked for me:

1. n8n was too complex / rigid for blog article automation
2. ChatGPT wrote bad posts and only wrote one at a time.

So, I built a feature to generate 200 blogs on any given topic within my AI assistant itself; basically, I’m using my own tool to market itself. 

Here’s how it works:

1. It automatically searches up SERP content on the provided topic,
2. Comes up with a list of interesting and optimized ideas, 
3. Writes articles / blogs on each of them. 

I’ve found it super useful while trying to grow my startup’s blog. 

PS: If you’re a marketer / founder and want to use something like this, I’d love to offer it to you for free for some feedback. Lmk!"

Speaking from personal experience, I fell into a serious slump over the years while smoking weed. I stayed physically active, working out and running regularly, but when it came to tasks that required focus or finishing extra responsibilities, everything took me much longer to complete.

This is not an instant solution, but it is a valuable step toward becoming a better version of yourself. I am currently on my fourth day of sobriety, and

7,First client mad about having to pay for work after saying she'd pay for work,r/freelance,davelipus,20,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1kawm1j/first_client_mad_about_having_to_pay_for_work/,"Maybe this issue is as old as website work, but we're just starting out as a team in freelancing (my partner and I, though I did this as an amateur years ago), and she found a great client whom we're willing to do some free work for while learning the ropes again (especially to get something on the portfolio besides my tangential employee stuff), but had said she's willing to pay when the time comes. I mentioned a flat fee for releasing the website, but that we may charge hourly for changes beyond that or for back-n-forth work that may be extraneous to a minimum-viable product (MVP).

After we'd gone through several iterations of the site (all good learning experiences for us, maybe 25 hours of work all around, and not a complicated site), when the time came to release, she put it off and requested more changes, this time more deletions of previous work or re-wording or moving things around... it just began to feel like more busywork and delays than any sort of progress.

When I then mentioned payment for the release, an expected deadline, a site design for MVP, and hourly pay for re-doing things, she got upset and acted as if we never agreed to any payment, and is now threatening to not continue with the site and a sister site that we spent some hours on investigating and poking around with.

Unfortunately there's no formal written agreement, the business isn't registered yet, all we have is a brand website and our text/email communications (no meeting/call recordings since we've been easy-going and she's been super-nice). Frankly I don't understand the aggressive turn-around, and she spent more money with the previous people whose work she didn't like even though they didn't drop the ball on anything that I saw.

**Endpoint:** So, now that I'm back in the fray, what do you suggest for this client? My partner will try to salve things over through phone (since my comments were in email), but it appears the client misread and forgot about a lot of things discussed, and her personality didn't come off earlier as being anything like a deadbeat. She makes a lot of money and our charges are far lower than the standard.

Also any advice for new clients, I'm looking into getting contracts and a ramp-up workflow going (especially with project management), but it looks like it's gonna take a lot of time and possibly mistakes to get a smooth process from discussion to payment."

(Accrual basis),r/Bookkeeping,WorldlyInspection9,27,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bookkeeping/comments/1lsjcew/how_to_handle_bookkeeping_when_all_revenue_is/,"\*\*This was cross-posted to another sub. I am curious if somebody else deals with something like this with your clients and could share your approach.\*\*  
  
For background: I am a CPA and used to work in corporate accounting. I currently have a small accounting firm that provides outsourced accounting services to small businesses that do not have full time staff. I know my accounting well but sometimes it is a challenge when you have to bridge the gap between small business systems/processes and adequate accounting. So here I am.

I am dealing with a tricky situation with one of my clients (QuickBooks based) and it got me wondering how larger businesses with more mature systems handle this.

The client provides custom made products in bulk to other companies. Because the product is custom made, the client collects the payment up front and ships the product only once it is manufactured (abroad) and brought back in the US. It takes about 30-45 days. In order to create meaningful accrual financials, I have to review all inbound and outbound shipments and create manual journal entries to (1) defer revenues on the unshipped orders and (2) ensure COGS shows only what got shipped out and, if not, it is booked to inventory. I should note that the business does not generally hold inventory because it is a custom product so 100% gets shipped out to customers.

So the current system flow looks like this:

1. The client/business owner creates invoices in QuickBooks as soon as his customers place orders.  
2. Customers then pay invoices and they show as paid and booked to sales.  
3. At the end of the month, I review his shipping records and identify invoices that did NOT actually get shipped to customers. I then record a JE to move them from Sales to Deferred Revenue.   
4. I do the same on COGS side but let's focus on the revenue side first.

**If you work in a more mature company that has similar revenue flows (prepayments a month or two in advance), how do you execute this all in the accounting system to ensure your accrual financials are adequate?** I know one way is to record everything to deposits first but the client wants to see all details broken down on the invoice that goes out to the customer at the time of the payment request so that requires creating an actual invoice. The current process is very tedious on my end so I am curious how I can improve it, especially as the business is growing. For reference on volume, there are around 100 invoices per month."

Ive learnt some accounting concepts alr.

I am aware of accounting software like Zoho or Xero but don’t want to make the switch just yet. (Just doing on Google Sheets currently, run a online product business but do not issue invoices) I have a few questions regarding bookkeeping and would really appreciate your answers:

- What’s the most problematic part about bookkeeping besides that it takes a long time? I can’t seem to figure out what I’m doing wrong because it’s taking way too long to key in invoices from my suppliers and I only have 3
- How do you import transactions from your bank accounts? 
•	⁠What do you keep track of in Google Sheets (or the app you use)?
•	⁠How do you keep a chart of accounts properly? I can’t find a really detailed walkthrough from the answers below.
•	⁠Are there any applications that can help with accounting (on Google Sheets) or not that don’t cost a lot? Low cost is very impt for me

7,Stakeholders constantly complaining about being unaware. How much of this is my problem?,r/projectmanagement,lurkandload,30,75,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1lrptcn/stakeholders_constantly_complaining_about_being/,"I setup a project dashboard, with live statuses from projects and their files. It’s a very simple and organized view of the entire portfolio. It shows progress %, overall status, project name/description, and an “update” comment.

This dashboard is updated live from the project files. What I’ve consistently communicated is the dashboard is useful for the summary and if you want details, you can review the full project file.

Everyone in the org has automatic access to the software/tools/system.

There’s no reason they can’t review the dashboard, if they have questions they can review the full project file, and if they have more questions they can reach out to anyone on the team or myself and ask.

Despite all of this, my boss and the leadership team I am part of seem to be talking amongst themselves about how this process is not meeting their needs. 

I say this because within 2 weeks, each of them have brought up to me that they aren’t confident in certain projects. (And other non-positive feedback).

My boss also says she needs to see a specific plan for who is doing what by when, etc.

I have had this exact information decided/planned for 6 months and have had it saved in the common location for anyone to review.


The bottom line for how I see it is - I am providing consistent information and have setup systems for everyone to interact with that information. The real problem is that they aren’t engaging with any of it and instead are making assumptions that I’m just simply bad at my job or something.

My boss and I have never clicked, I started reporting to her 6 months ago. I used to love my job, I now can’t stand it. She is condescending and constantly changing her mind and canceling work that I’ve invested weeks of time in.

For example, I started a content outline for a training plan to get project owners to the same baseline. I brought it to a 1:1 and said “do you think this is worth continuing?” She was super excited, “yes this is exactly what we need I love it”. A week later, at our next 1:1, “hey I need you to stop work on the training plan and just use corporate training”… 

So, I wasted a week of my time. And the corporate training is just a sharepoint site with click-through “modules” etc. completely different from the problem I was trying to solve.

Regardless - this was not intended to be a rant about my boss. 

Does anyone have any experience or advice I can lean on for this? 

Thank you!

EDIT ———

Adding one of my comments below, for context:

My stakeholders for this issue specifically are just the others on my team - functional managers.

My previous boss specifically asked for the dashboard because everything was so chaotic at first, we needed a single place for all projects.

And yes, I’ve been begging for requests / feedback / suggestions for 1.5 years.

I tried emailing requesting feedback, and following up with reminders to say I haven’t gotten a response.. no response

I’ve tried ms forms links, so all they have to do is click an answer.. maybe I would get 2 or 3 out of 12 to respond.

I called a recurring meeting with JUST us, the leadership team, every two weeks. I sent out a poll/asked directly before hand what day works best for them… and still, they would show up late or not at all, with no notice.

In that meeting I presented a communication plan, complete with slides/templates and overall strategy - I highlighted what’s new/different, and I asked for their feedback on the plan.

I also directly said “this is me asking you for help”

It took us 3 meetings like this, with no progress or agreement, for me to just give up and cancel the meeting.

The best way to describe it is, to them, it doesn’t matter until it matters.. and wouldn’t you know it, it’s time for mid-year reviews and suddenly everyone is very interested in projects"
7,"Problem project. Not a PM, but trying to learn!",r/projectmanagement,bloopityb00p,7,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1ln3065/problem_project_not_a_pm_but_trying_to_learn/,"Hi, everyone. I'm not a officially Project Manager, but I feel like I can pick up skills from the PM skill set and apply them to the work I do.

I work for a small electrical supplies distributor. I don't really have a job title - if I have to put something down, I usually put ""Inside Sales"" or ""Sales Associate."" My actual duties entail quoting customers, processing orders, placing orders for material, working with my warehouse to coordinate deliveries, and fielding customer questions and providing updates. Often, I'm supporting a salesman who has gotten an order, but does not have the organizational capabilities to execute (a good chunk of the salesmen are elderly). I mainly utilize Excel and Google Sheets, and my company uses a CRM (Creatio) to keep track of daily tasks.

In November, we were awarded a contract by a longtime customer to supplies thousands of LED lamps and lighting fixtures to several facilities. The salesman who bid this contract is an owner of my company who has been working with this customer since the 80's, so he was very pleased to get this. However, the project of fulfilling these huge orders has been very fraught from the beginning. The customer made several demands that put us in a bad position: they rushed us to order material at a pace our warehouse struggled to keep up with, made us store the material for longer than agreed, and made us swap out one brand of lamp for another, which cost us in return fees and labor.

When material was finally delivered (6+ months after we ordered this material for them), the customer reported huge material shortages. Because we held onto this material so long, we are out of the period where we can request no-cost replacements and are on the hook financially for this missing material. We've been able to locate some of the stuff (our leadership made our warehouse do a rigorous check of what we still had in-house, and even I dug through boxes to find materials my warehouse had missed), but we are still missing about $12k worth of material.

I have ultimately escalated this to management and the salesman to resolve. I can't order $12k worth of stuff and give it to the customer as free replacements without approval - my hands are tied. I've also had a bit of a hard time communicating with this customer - I've tried to get ahead of certain things with them, but they are not super responsive by email. I've spoken to them on the phone and asked them to review the list of missing materials so they can confirm we're on the same page about what's missing, and explained my management's reluctance to re-order things, but these were more junior members of the customer's team, and they never gave meaningful feedback to my prompting.

I do think I ultimately messed up by not over-communicating regarding this particular situation and not covering myself better. They weren't really expediting aggressively, but I believe I am at least partially responsible for a communication breakdown occurring. One of the customer's project leaders finally asked ""when are we getting this stuff?"" Obviously, his junior colleagues have not clued him in on what's going on, and I'm certain he's going to be angry about the delay it will cause for the project on his end (our customer is managing the installation of the lights). Both myself and management agree that the salesman ultimately needs to speak with them to resolve this and establish the direction we're taking, because I've more or less hit a wall and don't have the authority to fix it by myself.

Now that I've written this novel (and it's still very abridged), here's where I'm curious about PM resources and skills. I'm of the opinion that this project was not well-planned from the beginning, the salesman did not push back enough the customer's demands and control their expectations, and there wasn't really a process in place to mitigate risk. I don't have a team to delegate tasks to: other than the warehouse who is physically handling the material, it's only been me performing tasks to complete the orders and interfacing with the customer.

Should another project like this land in my lap, what can I do to try and coordinate things better from the beginning? Where can I learn about risk assessment/mitigation and bring it up to my management? What are the best practices for communicating with a customer who's difficult to communicate with? Are there any PM tools that might be helpful? I consider myself pretty organized and detail-oriented, but this project really threw everybody for a loop, and I would like to develop whatever skills I can to try and prevent something like this from ever happening again. 

If you have taken the time to read this post, I really appreciate it. I would love any advice/tips you can offer. Thank you!"

I'll be real - my 6' of counter space was covered in cabinet contents (1/2 of a medium moving box worth) and the canned goods were still in the pantry. 

My husband works overnight, so my plan has always been to load up until he goes to bed around 2, then clean the rest of the night. By the time he comes home at 7:30am all that's left to do is throw 3 mattresses in the truck and drive away. 3 bedrooms and 1 bathroom have been untouched for 2 weeks to streamline everything.

Yes many other countries with free healthcare can cost a lot in taxes. However, in the US, you have to get insurance which means you have to work. If you don't work and don't have insurance, you're literally screwed. If something happens to you and have to go to the hospital, the bill is literally crazy and it will put you in debt or put you in a bad financial situation. Some people will actually not get certain emergency health problems taken care of for the simple fact they know it will be expensive and cost thousands of dollars. Even having an abulance come to your house will bill you thousands of dollar. Hospitals in the US also like to up bid everything- which makes the cost of everything healthcare related, way more expensive in the US, and if you dont have insurance, you have to pay it all out of your pocket while other countries get it for free. Yes we people in the US have insurance, and your insurance will cover some things, but it will not cover everything and you'll still get billed on some things. Then there's the hassle of insurance companies not always wanting to pay for certain things and you have to negotiate with them which is annoying. Other countries say, ""at least you don't have to pay as much taxes."" Well the thing is in the US, having medical insurance will still deduct a lot of money from your weekly paycheck and the cost is a lot! Some people say it's almost as much as the cost of rent at a cheap apartment. I don't know if it's more than what other countries pay in taxes but I know it's a lot. Other countries then say ""at least there isn't a long waiting list and you get better treatment"" from my experience, I still had to wait a long time for many appointments and the treatment still isn'tthay great in my opinion. I would rather wait a long time and at least get something done for free then to have to pay it through medical insurance or out of pocket."

I’m a software developer working on a concept for an **AI‑powered L&amp;D platform** designed specifically for corporate and professional trainers (L&amp;D teams, HR, training consultants, etc.). The goal is to empower instructional designers to:

* **Generate training materials** (labs, exercises, simulations, quizzes, performance evaluations) from internal documentation sources
* **Streamline branching,** so learners can ""choose their own (education) adventure,"" so to speak
* **Digital teaching avatars** to personalize the training experience with a ""human"" delivery
* **Allow on-demand learner questioning** so follow-up responses can be given
* **Integrate with your systems** (LMS, HRIS, SSO, document export)
* **Enable analytics** for measuring impact, tracking engagement/error patterns
* **Ensure corporate compliance &amp; privacy** (bias safeguards, data protection, audit trails)
* **Support PD/training AI‑fluency** for trainers

We’re inspired by tools like [MagicSchool ](https://www.magicschool.ai/)(built for schools)—it offers features such as lesson/unit plan generators, rubric/quiz makers, writing feedback, chatbots, image‑based activities, export options, and strong privacy measures ([magicschool.ai](https://www.magicschool.ai/magicschool?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [magicschool.ai](https://www.magicschool.ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [magicschool.ai](https://www.magicschool.ai/magic-tools?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

——

**I’d love your insight on a few things:**

1. **Is this something your organization would find useful?**
   * Where in your current process do you hit bottlenecks or waste time?
2. **Which features matter most?**
   * Should we prioritize scenario/lab generators? Performance evaluation rubrics? Skill assessments? Chatbot-based coaching or simulation tools? LMS/HR-system linking? Analytics &amp; compliance?
3. **Would you invest in this?**
   * Would a per-seat license, org-wide package, or pay-per-use model resonate more?
   * What price or model would feel reasonable?

**Bonus question:** Are there features I’ve missed that would be game-changers in your training workflow?

No product link—just trying to frame what could be real and useful for you all. Really appreciate any thoughts or feedback!

Thanks in advance 🙏

Once the niche is given, research is done everyday via Tavily. The research is passed off to your LLM of choice which writes the script in whatever sort of voice / tone you want, and then that script is given to HeyGen, which generates a video of your AI avatar reading the script. From there it is posted on whatever socials you want via Blotato.

Setting up your avatar on HeyGen is surprisingly painless. Their pricing structure can be a little tricky though-- while you can get 10 video credits (10 minutes worth of video) on their free API plan, the next tier up will run you $99 / m. Sort of annoying that there is no mid tier between those two points but it is what it is.

Tavily gives you hundreds of searches for free every month so no cost there. LLM API costs will also be negligible. Posting to socials is done via Blotato here, which runs $29 / m. Alternative options include upload-post at a slightly lower price point.

More than anything, this workflow is a blueprint for you to leverage HeyGen AI avatars in the social media space. While this automation uses trending topics in your niche as a use case, that can really be swapped out for anything you deem relevant.

As the AI clone / avatar tech gets better and better, you're going to be seeing a lot of this-- for better or worse."

6,Voice calls are recovering $50k+/mo in abandoned checkouts for our car parts store,r/ecommerce,Beginning-Pie5972,0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1lu44wv/voice_calls_are_recovering_50kmo_in_abandoned/,"Thought I’d share something that made a big impact on our business, in case it helps anyone in a similar boat.

We run a DTC store selling aftermarket car parts, mostly performance mods and accessories. One constant headache has been abandoned checkouts. We’d get hundreds each week, especially for higher-ticket items, and email/SMS reminders only did so much.

What ended up working surprisingly well was using voice calls to follow up on abandoned carts. Not a call center, we tried that and it felt clunky. Instead, we started using this custom AI voice agent that reaches out a few minutes after someone leaves the site. It speaks naturally, answers basic questions, and nudges them to complete the order. All automatically...

I was skeptical at first, but it’s been recovering over $50k/month in otherwise lost revenue. It works especially well with our audience, people tend to trust a real-sounding voice more when spending $300+ on performance parts.

It wasn’t an off-the-shelf solution either, it was built and optimized specifically for our use case, including handling the kinds of objections we usually get on the phone (shipping questions, compatibility doubts, etc.).

Anyway, just wanted to share since I hadn't seen many people talk about voice for recovery. If anyone’s curious about how we set it up, feel free to DM me."
6,How can I get bulk clients for my clothing brand within India without relying on social media marketing?,r/ecommerce,CrusherAWSRD,3,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1ls3myy/how_can_i_get_bulk_clients_for_my_clothing_brand/,"Hi everyone,

I run a clothing brand in India that offers print-on-demand apparel with customized packaging.

We also provide DTF, DTG, and screen printing, along with custom neck labels and branded packaging.

I am specifically looking to secure bulk orders from domestic clients such as boutiques, retailers, and private label brands. But I would prefer to avoid typical online marketing channels like Instagram or other social media promotions.

I would appreciate any suggestions on platforms, directories, trade shows, local networks, or offline strategies that could help me reach businesses interested in buying in bulk within India. Also open to hearing about your experiences with building B2B relationships in this sector.

6,MSSP: Do we need a PSA?,r/msp,pakillo777,3,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1lrfi1h/mssp_do_we_need_a_psa/,"Hey there, we are an MSSP providing offsec services, consulting services, and managed security services.   
The first two are consulting based, and with their respective project management solutions and collaborative workplaces we have it pretty well figured out management-wise.  
  
However, in the managed services part, which we're growing very fast, we provide MDR, cloud backups, some Microsoft stuff, and other services.   
We are using an ERP for invoicing/accounting/billing, but the current workflow is to manually check the licenses usage on each client on their tenant on each app, and put them on the monthly invoice in the ERP. They sometimes vary month-to-month so they have to be checked and done manually every time.   
However, there are quite a few multi-tenant style services we are providing which have scattered dashboards and licensing, such as DNSFilter, DLP solutions, or the aforementioned MDR &amp; Cloud Backups.

While some of them get grouped and licensed via PAX8, others don't. As of now it's just  a couple/4 hours at the end of each month, including other accounting tasks, so it's not something to change immediately.

However, I do think this might get unsustainable in the near future with the current growth. 

Do we need a PSA? If so, which one is suggested? We plan on acquiring or building an MSP in the mid/long term, so if it's something compatible for both MSSPs and MSPs alike, it'd be great.

Thanks in advance!"
6,"My neighbors have unhinged, screaming, likely drug fueled sex all day and all night. It deprives me of sleep and severely stresses me out. When confronted, they gaslight me. How can I build a case to put an end to this?",r/legal,Trapezoidoid,0,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1lu1udv/my_neighbors_have_unhinged_screaming_likely_drug/,"Location: Pennsylvania

This has been going on for roughly six months. In order to get away from it I recently moved out of one apartment to a different one two doors down the street. Imagine my abject horror when it turns out my new neighbors must be friends with my old ones because the exact same problem is present in the new place. All day and night I hear at least one woman, sometimes two or three, full-on SCREAMING phrases like “**** me harder daddy” or “oh my ****” or “I’m gonna ****ing cum” over and over and over, hour after hour. It’s absolutely maddening and frankly disturbing. It’s highly deviant, almost certainly drug fueled stuff. For the record, I really don’t care that they’re doing this - I’m not clutching my pearls here. The problem is that I’m forced to bear constant witness to it against my will. It’s breaking me down. I can’t take it anymore.

In the first apartment I tried talking about it with the tenant but they just gaslit me and denied that anything like that was happening, usually claiming they weren’t even home. They also happen to be friends with that landlord there and were able to convince building management that I am just crazy and hearing things. I also tried calling in a noise complaint at one point but it didn’t pan out because they take measures to make it look like they aren’t home. After moving, however, I have a new landlord and a fresh opportunity to take action on this. I don’t think the neighbors are as close to this landlord as the old one. I haven’t mentioned anything about this to the new landlord yet as I figure I should produce some kind of evidence to show first. I’m currently attempting to find a good way to record audio - I dabble in music and happen to have some recording equipment. I’m also considering installing security cameras to keep track of who’s coming and going from this building (it’s a duplex).

The question is, if and when I produce evidence that this is going on, what should I do next? Should I show it directly to the landlord, take it to the police, or lawyer up right away? I think police involvement could potentially be beneficial as there is reasonable suspicion of drug activity and possibly even prostitution. I also figure that if I go to the landlord, the tenant will simply deny it and plant the seed that I’m just crazy to him. My ultimate goal, assuming they signed the same lease that I did, is to have them evicted on the grounds that they are using the property for “illegal or disorderly conduct.” Do I stand a chance at success if I go this route?"

Gather ‘round, kids, and let me tell you the tale of their fearless Chief Technical Officer, Leon Dayovan, a man so spectacularly unqualified he makes a potato look like a supercomputer.

This is the guy in charge of all the technology at Dave’s Hot Chicken;despite the minor detail that he doesn’t actually understand any of the technology. You know, tiny things like how the POS works, what an API does, or how not to lose millions in sales.

It’s honestly beautiful in a tragic sort of way. Watching him in a meeting is like watching someone confidently give a TED Talk about spark plugs while holding them upside down and calling them “revenue engines.”

He doesn’t have a technology degree, or really any background besides being really, really good at stringing together corporate buzzwords like:
	•	“synergistic alignment,”
	•	“cloud-based omnichannel optimization,”
	•	and my personal favorite: “strategic innovation pipeline.”

Translation: He has no clue what he’s talking about.

Meanwhile, every system he touches melts into a glorious puddle of dysfunction:
	•	Orders vanish into the abyss like a magic trick nobody asked for.
	•	Reporting is so inaccurate you’d get more reliable numbers from a fortune cookie.
	•	Integrations are “live” in the same way your grandma’s AOL email still “works.”

But please, let’s all give him a standing ovation, because apparently if you throw enough jargon at the wall, you can convince an entire executive team that you’re a visionary.

Honestly, if it didn’t impact real customers and real money, I’d almost admire the hustle. Almost.

⸻

TL;DR:
Their CTO is basically a corporate performance artist whose medium is chaos. But don’t worry—he’s “driving innovation.” Just don’t ask him where the engine is.

6,Best online accounting software for small nonprofits?

Honestly, it’s been one of the better decisions we’ve made on the operations side. We don’t have a full-time accountant, but with QBO we’ve been able to keep track of donor contributions, categorize restricted vs unrestricted funds, and generate reports that make sense for board meetings.

I especially like how customizable the chart of accounts is. We set up different classes for each program and it’s been a huge help during grant reporting. We also connected our bank and credit card accounts, so transactions come in automatically and we just review and categorize. The monthly reconciliation takes me 20 minutes now, compared to hours before.

One thing I’m wondering about is whether others here use QBO’s budgeting tools for projecting grants or multi-year program funding. I’ve only scratched the surface on that. If your nonprofit is using QBO, what features are you leaning on most? Are there hidden tools I should explore?"

We are reorganizing the sales dept around two salespeople, and we will each have to manage significant volume.

Beyond that, we are not so sure. We don't have the techiest team and therefore don't want something particularly complicated to set up or integrate, but we realize we'll have to invest time and money to get a good setup going. 

  
I'm looking at so many different pieces of software, and I'm new to this kind of high-volume, automated sales. I don't really even know where to begin on making a decision. What's a good way to begin?

There are so many options out there—Buffer, Hootsuite, SocialBee, SocialPilot, Sendible, and more—that it’s tough to figure out which one actually delivers the best value for money **without sacrificing reliability or essential features**.

* Which tool are you currently using, and how much are you paying?
* Have you experienced any major issues (missed posts, glitches, poor support)?
* How easy is it to set up bulk scheduling or evergreen/recycled posts?
* Any hidden costs or limitations I should be aware of?

**From what I’ve researched so far:**

* **SocialBee** is often recommended as the best overall for automation and is pretty affordable, with strong AI features for scheduling and content recycling.
* **Buffer** is praised for its simplicity and has a decent free plan, but the paid plan is $6/month per channel, which can add up if you have a lot of accounts.
* **SocialPilot** and **Sendible** are also mentioned as affordable options, especially for agencies or those managing multiple clients.

I also completed the coursework for the applied math program but was unable to switch what was listed on my diploma.

When I was at my Uni I worked with a research group to troubleshoot and extend their custom data entry and analysis scripts that were written in python using tkinter and pandas. The year before dropping out I was a TA for an intro to abstract algebra course. These were both part-time paid positions with the university.

I haven't had a full-time job as a W-2 employee since I worked as a server nearly 8 years ago. I've just been doing freelance work as a math tutor, A/V technician, web designer, among some other things these last few years.

I have high level proficiency in using python and some of its libraries (pandas, numpy, scipy, writing scripts to clean up .csv files). Proficiency with MATLAB, R, Excel/Google Sheets, C/C++, JavaScript, SQL, rust. I know how to properly leverage AI to expedite my workflow without sacrificing accuracy. I have taken courses on Operations Research and have experience with linear and dynamic programming methods.

I guess my questions are:

What are my prospects of getting an interview and landing a position having previously dropped out of school and having a spotty employment history?

What should I focus on in my resume and how should I address any gaps in employment/education?

Should I create a new GitHub and do analysis on some existing datasets to build a portfolio?

What other skills should I focus on learning (Tableau maybe?) and what else can I do to improve my chances of finding work.

Do I have a chance in a competitive job market with so many younger recent grads that have stronger resumes than I do?

I’ve been in a Programme/Project Manager role for a year now, SDM before that, and lately I’ve been feeling like I’m falling short - but I’m not sure if it’s just perception, real gaps in performance, or a bit of both.

I’ve started tracking my daily pros and cons at work to figure out what’s going wrong, and a few things keep coming up:

I get chased a lot, mainly by my manager, for updates on emails, customer actions, or general progress. The thing is, I am doing the work most of the time, I’m just not always sharing updates unless prompted. I think this makes me look like I’m not on top of things, even when I am.

What confuses me is I have a colleague who supports a different customer, and they don’t seem to get chased at all. They also forget to post their Slack updates more than I do, and they’re definitely not sending hourly status updates. I can’t tell if they’re just better at making people feel confident in them, or if expectations are just different.

I tend to gravitate toward fun or low-pressure work, like help guides, process stuff, or AI tooling, specially when I’m overwhelmed. I know it’s still valuable, but it’s not always the priority, and I sometimes leave the more critical, high-visibility tasks too late.

I recently got some pretty harsh customer feedback that went up to senior leadership. I’ve made changes since (calendar alerts, inbox rules, structured planning), and my follow-up meeting went well, but I still feel really awkward. Like people have already made up their minds about me.

One of my customers is particularly hard to manage, they have high expectations but don’t pay for dev time, so I can’t get traction internally. I don’t want to be blunt and say “you won’t get anything unless you pay,” but I also can’t promise things that won’t happen. I feel stuck.

I’ve had some good days, getting through my whole task list, ticking off actions, even getting praise, but then I’ll have a slow day and the doubt creeps back in. I’m trying to rebuild my confidence quietly, but I keep feeling like I’m just not very good at this job.


So I guess I’m here to ask:

How do you make yourself look proactive and reliable without flooding people with updates?

How do you manage difficult customers with no funding but high expectations?

And more generally, how do you get better at being a PM? I feel like I’ve plateaued or hit some invisible wall, and I don’t want to quit I want to actually improve.


Would really appreciate any insight or experiences from people who’ve been through something similar. Thanks in advance."

My job involves designing doors for customers and I'm looking at ways to help manage all my tasks. The gist of it is this:

* I start off by contacting customer
* two weeks later I start designing their door
* then back and forth between me and client depending on number of design changes (they could approve the initial design, or they may have weeks of design changes)
* once approved I do a cad drawing for joinery workshop
* once door is manufactured I measure and order any glass if needed
* track glass orders and mark off when we have them in stock
* door goes out for install

The problem I'm having is I feel like I'm using too many tools but not getting what I want from them either. I'm trying to automate some aspects (reminder to email client at the start of project, reminder to start design phase 2 weeks later, warning/notification 1 month before the job is due to be installed)

Notion I basically just started using as a daily/weekly to-do list (might stop this as it's not any different to using a notepad)

Monday seems ok, but it is already running quite sluggishly and I've only about 20 projects tracked in it in a very basic way. I like the automations though for emailing me a reminder.

I'm just wondering if there's better tools suited to my needs or if I'm over complicating things by using too many different tools. I just find I'm spending more time updating the tools than doing what I'm meant to be doing at the minute. I used to just use excel and a notepad but I wanted a way to send me reminders too...

I've also added some images of what I use Monday and excel for

Mall employees today, do you still feel it?",r/retail,Alman54,22,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/retail/comments/1lsd21z/there_was_a_certain_camaraderie_of_employees/,"I worked at Waldenbooks in the mall 1990 to 1992, also Suncoast Motion Picture and CPI Photo Finish at different times. I often interacted with other mall employees who came in or when I would visit other stores during my breaks.

I spent a lot of time In Musicland browsing, buying, and hanging out with employees I had made friends with.

Even at the food court, I became acquainted with employees when I would order frequently.  Some stores or food places offered 10% discounts to mall employees. I bought pretzels at Auntie Ann's just about every shift. Or gummy bears at Mr. Bulky.

There was a kinship, a camaraderie among the mall employees. It was like all of us being stuck there together in all of our various stores gave us a community that excluded customers and the real world outside the mall.

I miss that sense of community in a way. The feeling was like we were all in it together, separated by walls and floors. But we we knew and felt each others' pain or pride.

Does that camaraderie still exist today? What are your stories from past and present?"
5,How to express dissent within a nonprofit?,r/nonprofit,Independent_Mud_2730,23,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/1lt9t4s/how_to_express_dissent_within_a_nonprofit/,"Hi all, 

As the title says, I'm wondering how to express dissent with a decision being made within the nonprofit that I work for. 

I am a youth educator working for a non-profit, and our area and industry has recently been hit with a massive natural disaster. This has left us with some questions of how to move forward with some of our programming. A group of Managers, Directors and C-suite members came together and discussed alternative plans, and came up with one that felt doable and appropriate given the circumstances. This plan was presented to our CEO, who promptly rejected it and proposed a different plan- one that many of us believe is not as sound, considerate or appropriate, but as she is the CEO, we have moved forward with it. 

I am going to execute this plan to the best of my abilities, as is my obligation to my position, staff members and the youth that we serve, but I feel a need to express my disagreement with how this process has gone, and to have documentation that this was not the plan that we suggested, and not the plan that I feel is the best course of action. Without going into too much detail, because of the recent natural disaster and tragedy associated with it in our direct geographical area and our industry, sensitivities are extremely heightened regarding child safety, liability and disaster response, and I do not believe our plan moving forward takes all of this into account.

I do not have regular direct contact with our CEO, as this is not quite the norm within our organization. I am considering writing a ""Statement of Concern"" via email to her, and CC'ing my direct supervisors. Partly for my own peace of mind, and to have it on record that this is not the plan I suggested, just in case (God forbid) anything went sideways during our alternate plan, I would have something to fall back on in terms of liability. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? What methods do you recommend for expressing dissent within a nonprofit? Any advice appreciated. "
5,my Next.js boilerplate made 34 sales and $2600+ in 15 days,r/SaaS,crololocro,22,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1lu3614/my_nextjs_boilerplate_made_34_sales_and_2600_in/,"I always chose Next.js, Supabase, Shadcn UI, and Stripe for my projects. I supported open source whenever I could and tried to use OSS tools as much as possible. But almost every time, I ran into bloated codebases filled with features I didn’t need. Nothing worked out of the box. I had to rewrite more than 80% of the code just to make it fit my needs. Even duplicating my own launched projects required heavy rewrites.

I also tried a few paid starter kits. But they came with overly complex integrations, unfamiliar stacks, and constant bugs.

So I decided to build my own boilerplate, [NeoSaaS](https://neosaas.dev).

Anyone who ships regularly knows how mentally and physically draining it is to fight with boilerplate code every single time just to get started. NeoSaaS is built with the modern stack most indie makers already use: Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind, Shadcn UI, Google Analytics (or Datafast), and Stripe.

NeoSaaS works like this:

1. Add your environment variables
2. Run the SQL on Supabase
3. You’re ready to ship

That’s all. No unnecessary dependencies. No overly opinionated structure. No tech stack you’ve never touched before.

After 15 days, I got 34 sales with early adopter pricing. (If anyone need proof I can send).

More importantly, I received thoughtful feedback from people who actually used the product. People who bought it, or even just tried the demo, reached out with genuine support.

5,9 marketing tools I actually use every single day (and why),r/SaaS,vox_nihili_ist,17,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1ltxnz0/9_marketing_tools_i_actually_use_every_single_day/,"Just wanted to share some tools I use every day as a SaaS founder who mostly does marketing.

A little about me for context:

* Founder of 5 products in edtech, productivity, and martech
* Scaled all of them to 1M+ users
* Two times VC-raised, three times bootstrapped
* Been doing this for 10+ years, tried pretty much every imaginable growth channel

These aren’t random tools I tried once, they are part of my real stack:

* Loops.so ($50/mo or free if you’ve got under 1,000 subs) — Super clean, dead simple for both email marketing and transactional emails. Love how easy it is.
* Hunter.io ($25/mo) — Been using this one for years. Hands down my go-to for lead gen and outreach.
* Canva Pro ($15/mo) — We use Canva for anything design, easy and fast.
* Foreplay.co ($59/mo) or Magritte.co (free) — Both are solid for ad inspiration if you run paid ads. Foreplay gives you a massive scraped library; Magritte is curated, cleaner, and easier to search. Can’t recommend them enough. 
* ChatGPT ($20/mo) — Daily use for me. Drafting copy, brainstorming ideas, rewriting headlines, summarizing content, it’s like a creative partner that doesn’t sleep.
* TinyPNG (Free) — Quick and easy image compression. Keeps everything fast-loading without losing quality.
* LinkedIn (69/mo) — Beyond posting, we use it for manual, highly targeted outreach. Still one of the best B2B tools if you know how to use it.
* Notes (Free) — I’ve tried all the productivity tools. Ended up back on Notes for managing to-dos, prompts, random ideas, lists, etc.
* Screen Studio ($229 one-time) — The cleanest, smoothest way to make product demo videos. Looks pro with minimal effort.

Curious what other founders are using daily. What’s in your stack?"
5,AI enabled learning all hype?,r/Training,Sad-Recognition-8257,4,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Training/comments/1kfeaww/ai_enabled_learning_all_hype/,"Every large company I've seen, including ours (think 30,000 people, dozens of countries, multiple languages), gets all hyped about sophisticated L&amp;D. Shiny LMS platforms, mandatory hour-long e-learnings, live VILT sessions scheduled across timezones. We pour resources into creating comprehensive training, like getting *everyone* upskilled on foundational AI.

Then what happens? The content goes into the system to die. Engagement is a battle, requiring tons of clicks just to find the damn module. Completion rates are... well, let's just say 'aspirational'. We *need* tangible results, like proving actual AI adoption lifted significantly, but it feels impossible to measure impact when you can barely get people *into* the training without pulling them from their actual jobs for hours.

The reality is the *real* knowledge on how things get done, or even the practical application of new skills like AI, feels 99% tribal, locked within specific teams or regions. Policies and skills exist *on paper* (or in the LMS void), but consistency across a global workforce speaking 13 languages? Forget it.

And when balls get dropped, or we need to pivot quickly, or just ensure *everyone* actually adopted the new AI tools we trained them on? It's always a fire drill. CONSTANTLY reinventing the wheel on how to *actually* make learning stick and change behavior at scale, without losing thousands of hours of productivity.

Is this just our massive global company, or am I just screaming into an empty Teams channel for no reason?

Now we're getting pushed with tools like Arist. They are selling our leadership about AI helping create and translate this stuff super fast. But can that *really* work for complex topics across a giant, diverse workforce? Or is it just another gimmick destined for the graveyard next to that unused module from last year?

Worried these new AI tools are just going to generate *more* content that nobody actually absorbs unless we fundamentally fix the delivery problem. What are you all seeing actually *work* for driving real adoption and skills at scale?

Edit: i have no relationship with Arist or any other learning platform."
5,New r/agency Subreddit Rule and Automod Update,r/agency,JakeHundley,30,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/agency/comments/1lsd2za/new_ragency_subreddit_rule_and_automod_update/,"Hey everyone,

This community has grown quite a bit since new moderators took the helm at the beginning of the year.

# Update to Rule #6

This was originally only for people just sending unsolicited DMs. Of course, there is no way to police this unless people report it (which no one does). 

This rule is being updated to ""No Unsolicited DMs or asking for DMs"".

The *""I built this automated system for my outbound sales AI agent using xyz. DM me for details""* posts are ending.

# New Rule #9

Previously, there had been a strict ""No self-promotion"" rule in the subreddit... and I mean *strict*.

We decided to change that as we recognize there are *some* people and businesses out there who genuinely do provide good solutions to questions and problems for people in this subreddit.

Instead of cherry-picking who those are, we made rule #8, ""Give More Than You Take"".

The intention is to allow people to help others because they care about the community but they also provide value such as free newsletters, podcasts, other groups, etc.

I get that in a lof of cases these are often lead magnets to the actual sale. But some aren't.

However, I'm seeing a lot more posts related to ""market research"" or asking for feedback on a service or tool for agency owners.

This subreddit is not for your market research. We all know you're just using your post as a way to get leads.

# Update to Automod

The automod features two main rules that prevent spam in this group:

* A rule that prevents people from posting if they have a karma in this subreddit of less than 3
* And a Contributor Quality Score (CQS) filter

The comment karma rule used to be set to 5. That means 5 upvotes, not just commenting 5 times. Your own upvote doesn't count.

This blocked a lot of people who were new to the sub and genuinely wanted to ask a question. 5 seemed to be too much so we lowered it to 3.

https://preview.redd.it/5r1uts8cu2bf1.png?width=2087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9a0dc3a1d67a13971839376ccbaab8f2abfc97c

The CQS filter was originally set to ""high"" around February. This presumably prevented a lot of spam but it also prevented some decent posts as well.

That caused me to drop it to Medium to see how it went.

https://preview.redd.it/gikdn5kvt2bf1.png?width=2132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d70dbf5eec806e1e08660cc8814b23ee6d78aa95

The problem was that I couldn't isolate whether it was the CQS filter reduction or the comment karma reduction that caused the increase in low-quality posts.

I've recognized that the comment karma rule can be realitevely easily gamed. That will stay at 3, but the CQS filter is going back to high.

# Legitimate Questions with Low CQS

The Automod is a robot and does not discriminate. Which means sometimes people do have genuine questions or posts but don't meet the CQS filter.

The mods here are human. If you believe your post is valuable, send a modmail to us.

Thank you to everyone who contributes here regularly!

We hope this community keeps growing and stays the #1 place for agency owners to collaborate!"

5,To my coach friends here: Skip the funnels for now — try this first,r/Coaching,Hopeful_Night_7292,8,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coaching/comments/1lhg42b/to_my_coach_friends_here_skip_the_funnels_for_now/,"Hey folks — I’m not a coach myself, but I’ve been a software freelancer for years and have faced the same uphill battle: how do you get consistent clients *without* throwing money at ads and fancy funnels?

Yesterday, I saw a coach here talk about spending thousands on Meta ads and lead systems that didn’t convert. I had to chime in, and surprisingly, my comment resonated. So I thought I’d expand on that idea here for others who might be struggling too.

Here’s what helped me early on — and I think it applies beautifully to coaching too:

**Start with 1:1 sales, not marketing.**  
Reach out to people in your niche. Offer a *free clarity call*. No pressure, no pitch. Just listen deeply and see if you can help. If it’s not a fit, ***walk away proudly***. You’re not here to convince, you're here to serve.

That mindset builds trust way faster than any ad copy or lead magnet.

Once you’ve had a few of these honest convos, your offer sharpens, your language clicks, and suddenly—*marketing starts to work*. But it starts with *sales rooted in empathy*, not conversion tactics.

Also — I recently read a thoughtful comment from a coach who also runs an automation company. He shared that even though he’s bullish on AI, he avoids automation for gaining 1-on-1 coaching clients. Why? Because people *know* when they’re being put through a system. For him, premium coaching means a personalized, congruent experience that can’t be automated. And that resonated a lot with me too.

And remember:

*Marketing is how people know you. Sales is how they trust and join you.*

  
As a software engineer, I never thought I’d say this—but sales and marketing have grown on me. Not because they’re flashy or clever, but because they taught me how to listen, serve, and build trust. And that’s something deeply human.

Hope this helps someone out there. Rooting for all of you doing meaningful work 🙌"

* Save incoming mobile numbers from calls and texts directly into the CRM
* Add notes or tags (""follow‑up,"" ""new lead,"" ""sent quote,"" etc.) on each contact—ideally with timestamps and easy scrolling
* Set simple reminders or tasks (e.g. “call back tomorrow,” “send follow-up text”) so nothing slips through the cracks
* Search, sort, and filter contacts on my phone
* Possibly integrate with SMS or call logs, or allow easy manual logging of interactions



Essentially, something that allows me with speed &amp; accessibility to save contacts and notes right after a call/text, without going on my computer. 

 I don’t need full pipelines, reporting dashboards, or deep integrations

Maybe just a simple list of upcoming tasks or follow‑up actions at a glance

I recently had a successful exit and wanted to share my story in hopes it may help someone else. 

Five years ago I decided to build a web app with no prior SaaS experience. Here’s the steps I took:

1.) Decided what to build. I decided to build a product that already has an existing market and competitors. I like to validate business ideas by using keyword research tools (eg. Google ads keyword planner) to confirm whether people are actually searching for that service or product, before building it. 

2.) Hire a developer on upwork  (I’m non-technical). It cost about $2k for the MVP. I did all the mocking up, product management, etc. myself. I didn’t hire a designer but I should have. 

3.) Got branding and website ready. I hired a logo designer on fiverr and created the website myself using Wordpress. 

4.) Launched product and did marketing. I’m a marketing expert, so I started getting paid users the very first week because I started marketing before it launched. I got thousands of website visitors and new app users every month using SEO. This means I created blog content and video content answering questions that potential customers are searching, and ranked in search engines. 

5.) Handle customer support, admin tasks, etc. I handled most things myself but hired sub contractors every now and then if I needed extra hands. 

6.) Sold the app. I decided to sell the app even tho it was making a stable income because i wasn’t passionate about the product or niche anymore and wanted to move on to other things. 

After I sold the app I launched a new one and am going through the same steps again. If anyone has any questions about building a SaaS, feel free to let me know! "

We went back and forth between our chargeback tool provider and Luqra, and it's 100% on Luqras end. They're double billing and banking on nobody catching it.

To make things even worse, they're now grabbing funds, holding back merchant settlements, and flat out refusing to reconcile hundreds of thousands they owe us.

They're constantly asking about more leads, higher ad spend, or hiring additional sales reps. Meanwhile, they're sitting on a goldmine of untapped revenue from customers they already have. I audited 10 SaaS companies last year and found the same pattern every time - massive money left on the table in four key areas that most founders completely ignore.

The biggest missed opportunity is expansion revenue from existing customers. Average SaaS companies get maybe 15% of revenue from expansions, while top performers hit 60% or more. Your current customers already trust you, know your product works, and have budget approved, yet most founders spend 80% of their energy chasing strangers. Then there's annual pricing - most companies offer weak 10% discounts that don't change behavior. The magic number is two months free for annual payments, which sounds expensive but is actually a 18% discount that feels like 25%. This moved one client from 20% annual customers to 65% annual customers overnight.

The other two goldmines are usage-based pricing and services add-ons. If your product has natural usage expansion like more users, data, or transactions, you should capture that value instead of charging flat fees regardless of growth. For services, your customers' biggest problem isn't usually your software - it's implementing it successfully. Instead of hoping they figure it out, sell implementation, training, and ongoing consulting. One client added success packages for $2K-5K and 30% of new customers bought them since it was mostly existing team time converted to pure profit.

New customers feel like growth while expansion feels like maintenance, acquisition has clear metrics while expansion requires creativity, and it's easier to blame lack of leads than optimize what you have. it's 5-10x easier to get more money from existing customers than acquire new ones at the same value, yet most SaaS companies spend 90% of their revenue optimization effort on acquisition. Look at your top 20 customers by usage or success and ask yourself how they could pay you 50% more for getting 50% more value. The answers are usually obvious once you actually look for them.

Hope it helps"
4,Why 'Saturated' Markets Are Actually Your Biggest Opportunity,r/startup,_AFakePerson_,10,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/startup/comments/1lp1wd2/why_saturated_markets_are_actually_your_biggest/,"Everyone says “find a blue ocean” and avoid crowded markets and when they cant they complain saying, “Every business idea is taken.”

Just because a competitor exists doesn’t mean they’re doing it right. Ask yourself:

* Can you do it simpler?
* Faster?
* Automated?
* Cheaper?

Competition isn’t your enemy, it’s your biggest advantage. A crowded market means there’s real demand and paying customers. When multiple companies fight for the same space, the market is proven. Better yet, competitors have already done the hard work testing pricing, positioning, and messaging. You get to learn from their mistakes.

Every negative review is a goldmine showing what’s broken and what customers still want. The gaps are there, waiting for you.

Example: I entered a super saturated market, AI prompt optimization with [PromptAlchemyLabs](https://promptalchemylabs.com/).

Here’s what I found after looking at the competition:

* *PromptPerfect:* Great AI optimization, but $19/month and overly complex.
* *AI Prompt Genius:* Organizes prompts well, but that’s all it does.
* *God of Prompts:* Huge library, but no easy access (no Chrome extension).
* *CustomGPT:* Good AI improvements, no organization.

Each tool nailed one thing, but no one built a full solution.

So I created a “Frankenstein” combining the best parts of each into one Chrome extension: AI-powered optimization + organization + library + always available where you work.

The “saturated” market basically gave me the perfect product roadmap.

# My 3-Step Competition Advantage Framework:

**1. Map the battlefield**

* List every competitor
* Try them extensively (take advantage of free trials) 
* Read all reviews (especially 2-3 stars)

**2. Find the gaps**

* What do users complain about?
* Which features need workarounds?
* What features are missing?
* do users juggle multiple tools?

**3. Build the bridge**

* Don’t try to beat everyone at everything
* Pick 2-3 key problems and solve them 10x better
* Make your product fit where users already work
* Price between cheapest and most expensive competitor

Saturated markets aren’t barriers—they’re blueprints. Use them."

4,Finally seeing results from cold email after a few tweaks,r/DigitalMarketingHelp,Open_Bank_5974,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalMarketingHelp/comments/1lc41m0/finally_seeing_results_from_cold_email_after_a/,"Been doing digital marketing for a while but always struggled with cold outreach. Decided to finally take it seriously last month.

Sent around 800 emails over 3 weeks. Nothing too fancy, just straight to the point, friendly messages offering a quick breakdown of how we help businesses grow their traffic without bloated ad budgets.

Out of that, 52 replied. 18 booked calls. Ended up closing 5 clients. Not bad at all considering the leads were totally cold.

For context, here’s the stack I used: 

– **Warpleads** to export leads in bulk (super helpful for volume) 

– **Reoon** to verify (cleaned out a bunch of dead emails) 

– **Mailforge** to get the infra/DNS stuff sorted 

– **Smartlead** to send in batches and follow up automatically

Still trying to improve reply rate (hovering around 6.5%). What’s your go-to opening line or subject line that gets actual responses?"

It’s usually word-of-mouth for me, but this year slowed down and I finally decided to try cold outreach properly.

I’ve tried before and got nothing, probably because I was emailing random people off sketchy lists. This time, I used **MailMiner** for unlimited data scraping to pull leads directly from LinkedIn Sales Navigator. I filtered for COOs in ecommerce companies with 10–50 employees. Not gonna lie, that filter alone made a big difference.

Sent out about 800 emails over 2 weeks. Short message focused on 3PL delays (a pain point I see a lot). Here’s how it went:

* 25 replies  
* 6 calls  
* 2 new clients (around $6K total)  

Not massive numbers, but honestly the most real traction I’ve ever gotten from cold email. Are you seeing better reply rates when your filters are really specific? What combos have actually worked for you in Sales Nav?"
4,Help Building My Business,r/SmallBusinessOwners,buccw1ld,4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmallBusinessOwners/comments/1kzz7y9/help_building_my_business/,"Hey everyone,

Just wanted to share a bit of my story and see if anyone out there has some advice or insight as I keep building.

I started a junk removal business in September 2024. At first, it was just me, a few friends, my dump truck, and a goal to make something shake. Around March 2025, I started getting handyman leads — drywall, appliance installs, minor plumbing, subfloor repairs, that kind of stuff. At first I didn’t have much experience with those services, but instead of passing on the work, I built a network of skilled handymen to knock out those jobs under my company name.

Since then, the work has picked up. I’m regularly handling everything from junk hauling to home repairs, gas line replacements, flooring, shower rebuilds, etc. Now I always find myself looking for a lot of the handyman and repair work, and I’ve been managing multiple contractors across different job types.

The money’s coming in a bit more consistently now, and things are growing — but I know I need better structure if I really want to scale this thing properly. Especially when it comes to finances. I’m looking for any advice from folks who’ve built service businesses or expanded contractor networks. Systems, hiring, delegation, automation — I’m open to learning and refining everything.

Appreciate anyone who’s willing to share some wisdom. Thanks for reading.

You know the drill - constantly resizing browsers, checking mobile layouts, creating bug reports...

What started as a simple ""capture any webpage"" tool now handles:

\-Full page screenshots (not just viewport)

\-Mobile device emulation

\-PDF generation

\-Even video recordings of sites

The part that surprised me: people are using it for stuff I never thought of. Competitor monitoring, social media content, automated reports...

Someone's using it to track price changes on e-commerce sites. Another person is creating tutorial GIFs.

But here's the weirdest one - people are using it to monitor Facebook ads instead of using Facebook's official API or other actors that give clean JSON data. I guess they prefer seeing the actual visual ad rather than just reading the data? Makes sense when you think about it - ads are visual after all.

Started as a personal pain point, now it's solving problems I didn't even know existed.

Anyone else building tools that ended up being used completely differently than intended?

that Facebook ads use case is actually pretty clever - visual monitoring vs just data makes total sense for ads!"

So what I do is simple I will need everyday fresh idle leads so that I will clear the sheet data (I know this is a mad thing to do but that is just my own requirement and I only knew this way to handle it)

After that it will get the date of thirty days ago from today. And send a custom supabase request for users who's recent login in greater than or equal to 30 days. And get back those Name, emails and the last login exactly. and remove any duplicates and store in google sheets and send personalised emails to the leads.

And obviously many people here are so talented and I am just a NOOB who had a little knowledge but I am constantly improving myself. So you are allowed to criticise this workflow and obviously give me any suggestions I would be glad :)"
4,automation vs full-code : When does visual automation become a trap?,r/automation,Specific_Dimension51,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1lt2l0f/automation_vs_fullcode_when_does_visual/,"Hi everyone,

I've been using **n8n** quite a bit lately and love how easy it makes certain automations — triggering workflows, integrating APIs, transforming data visually, etc. But I’m starting to feel like there’s a limit to what you can (or should) do inside a visual automation tool.

Once workflows become more dynamic — looping through items, handling conditions, branching, managing variables, and orchestrating complex steps — it starts to feel... fragile.  
The more I build, the more I feel like I’m using a screwdriver to hammer nails.

So here are my main questions:

* **When do you feel it's better to stop using n8n and switch to a proper backend (like Node, Python, etc.)?**
* Have you hit scenarios where n8n became more of a burden than a help?
* What are some **clear signs** that it's time to move to ""real"" code?
* Any tips on a **hybrid approach** — where n8n handles the orchestration, and the logic-heavy parts live in microservices?

I'm not anti-n8n at all — it's powerful and great for prototyping — but I'd love to hear from others who’ve faced that transition point:  
Where's the line between **""no-code wins""** and **""just write the damn function""**?

* Drag and drop site builder
* Blog
* Good review app (ideally Judge.me)
* Automated fulfillment (can send automated emails with order instructions to fulfillment center)
* Ability to restrict certain products for view by everyone but purchase by logged in members only

4,Non-IT Background – Should I Start with Data Analytics or Jump into Data Science/AI Directly,r/analytics,Few-Prune2972,0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/1ls8rke/nonit_background_should_i_start_with_data/,"Hey everyone!
I’m from a **Non-IT background**, but I’ve been exploring the world of **Data Analytics and Data Science** lately. My long-term goal is to become a **Data Scientist or work in AI/ML**, and I’ve picked up some basics through self-study.

However, I’m confused about where to begin seriously:
Some people say I should start with **Data Analytics** (Excel, SQL, dashboards, etc.) to build a solid foundation, while others suggest I can dive directly into **Python, statistics, ML, and modeling** even as a non-tech person.

If you’ve taken either of these routes, I’d love your input:

* Does starting with analytics help when transitioning into AI/ML later?
* Or is it better to directly jump into core Data Science concepts if I already know the basics?
* Also, how important are tools like **Power BI/Tableau** vs learning **Python, ML algorithms, and statistics** in the early phase?

I am trying to apply for general data analytics roles, as well as business and market analytics. I understand that these are different fields, but I am still trying to look into specific differences, and if you have any pointers on how resumes should differ between these, I would really appreciate that too.

  
As additional info, I do understand that the market is real tight right now, and I am also currently working on building a portfolio to show that I actually can effectively use tools listed in my resume and clean/analyze/visualize data in answering business-relevant questions. I also know that networking is very important, and will be working on that shortly.

4,DCF vs Market Multiple Discrepancy - Squarespace/Permira Deal Analysis,r/analytics,mrlawofficer,4,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/1lon244/dcf_vs_market_multiple_discrepancy/,"Been wrestling with the Permira-Squarespace deal mechanics and hitting a wall on the valuation reconciliation. Deal went from $6.9B initial to $7.2B final after ISS pushed back - but here's what's bugging me:

**The Numbers:**

* Final: $46.50/share ($7.2B EV)
* SQSP trading \~$32-35 pre-announcement
* 2023 Revenue: $1.04B, EBITDA: $285M
* FCF: \~$180M trailing twelve months

**The Problem:** When I run comps against other SaaS platforms (Shopify, Wix, GoDaddy), I'm getting \~6.5-7.0x EV/Revenue multiple, which puts fair value around $6.7-7.3B. Close to deal price.

But my DCF is way off. Using:

* WACC: 9.2% (given rate environment)
* Terminal growth: 3.5%
* Revenue growth: 12-15% (conservative given SMB headwinds)
* EBITDA margins expanding to 32% by year 5

DCF spits out \~$5.8-6.2B valuation range.

**Questions:**

1. Are private equity shops systematically paying market premiums and banking on operational leverage I'm missing in my model?
2. How do you weight control premiums in SaaS deals? Is 15-20% standard or am I being naive?
3. **Most importantly:** What am I screwing up in my FCF projections? SQSP has minimal capex needs (\~2% of revenue), but working capital movements are volatile quarter to quarter.

Anyone else worked similar SaaS take-private deals? The spread between methodologies feels too wide for comfort, especially when you're trying to justify valuations to skeptical boards.

**Another question:** How do you handle the tax efficiency argument when the target is already optimized? Permira's debt structure suggests they're counting on something beyond standard cost synergies. r/MergerAndAcquisitions "
4,software recommendations for small non-profit (&lt;$10k/year budget),r/Bookkeeping,wizendorf,3,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bookkeeping/comments/1lt36em/software_recommendations_for_small_nonprofit/,"Hi all, first time posting here so apologies if this post is off-topic

I have no bookkeeping background, but have volunteered to be a trustee of a very small community land trust in my neighborhood and help with their bookkeeping.

The trust just collects a small annual fee from all of the households in the neighborhood to pay for landscaping and upkeep of a few dozen acres of forests and lawns. Total income from the annual fee is well under $10k per year.

I am posting here to get some invoicing software recommendations from you folks.

We currently use an old-ish version of single-install QuickBooks (with a disk and everything). Here's what we use it for:

\- Create &amp; print invoices &amp; balance statements for \~200 households (""customers"") once per year for their annual fee, which are currently manually mailed

\- Manually log all received payments

QuickBooks Online is too expensive ($35/mo), and I'd like to move us to a web application with these features:

\- Import all household contact information

\- Create invoices &amp; account statements for all households in bulk (all households have the same fees every year)

\- Integrate with a snail mail service to send invoices &amp; account statements via USPS

\- Receive payments with support for convenient methods like credit card, Zelle, ACH, personal check

Bonus features:

\- Expense tracking for our recurring expenses (landscaping company, PO box, etc.)

My focus here is on low cost, support for bulk invoicing, and ease of use (trustees are volunteers and I can't assume any bookkeeping experience).

I have looked at Zoho and Odoo, and while they seem good and low cost, neither seems to support creating invoices in bulk (other than CSV imports). I've also looked at Wave and find that the free tier excludes too many basic features.

Do you guys have any recommendations?"

4,Troubles with my superiors at a lab,r/sysadmin,scantcloseness_3,4,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1ltpd4i/troubles_with_my_superiors_at_a_lab/,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I'm wondering if anyone can relate to this as a sysadmin entering the workforce at a college age. I have not had a job prior to earlier this year (freshman) after being recruited by a lab assistant leaving his workplace.

At the time of recruitment, the job seemed good enough for me as a student since it was part time and not in a corporate setting (science lab at my university). I can work almost fully remote and most of the communication is done via email and online meetings. The guy who offered it to me said it's pretty chill, consisting of web app maintenence and deployment, all done on-premises. As someone who also spends time in an OSS lab, I am well-versed in Linux server administration, containerization, virtualization, etc. so it was a good bet. I was also told I would be the only IT person there, which was probably an immediate red flag.

There were reliability issues with the on-prem server they, mind you, had for free from the OSS lab so they really wanted me to migrate it somewhere else. I tried to resolve these issues first, like installing a UPS, etc., because for some reason no one had a clue about it before me. The chairman was still dissatisfied and demanded migration to a different location. Sure, fine, we found a server at a different location. I realized that the student who worked in this position before me was not following good security and deployment practices so I had to rework the entire infra. Obviously that combined with the bureaucracy I had to go through before I even got a new server took a few months.

Then I of course had other duties such as tech maintenence, software updates, data prep, website updates, etc. in the span of around half a year (and counting). Though I have to mention that a huge chunk of it was composing emails to various departments of the university to get what the lab needed at the moment. At some point, boss was getting extremely pissy about me, thinking I'm doing my work poorly, not understanding lab goals, this that and the third. Sometimes I got blamed for everything wrong in his life, that I am hindering his work as a professor. Needless to say, however I was trying to justify myself it only aggravated him further. By then I also realized my contract was written by someone who is not tech competent so my official duties were pretty vague on paper. That along with demands to participate in events that had little to do with said duties. Oh, and even my littlest mistakes on site were brought up in emails and made me feel like shit. Coworkers who work closest with me never had a complain, though.

Anyway, my contract ends at the end of this year, and I am not extending it. Past few months have been hard on me mentally, especially with exams. I have been thinking of quitting early, but I appreciate the little money I can put on my savings account. This job made me realize no matter how competent and qualified you are for your job, you won't be appreciated enough by those who know jackshit about it."

# Summary

On June 21, 2025, the threat actor ""Anon-WMG"" claimed on the Exploit cybercrime forum to be selling an exploit targeting FortiGate firewalls with exposed APIs. The exploit is purported to work on FortiOS versions 7.2 and below, allowing the extraction of sensitive information such as firewall policies, VPN sessions, certificates, local users, and configuration backups. The actor claims the exploit supports multithreaded scanning and provides structured outputs in .json and .conf formats. The asking price for this exploit is $12,000.

Possible impact:  
• If unauthenticated, the exploit could dump &gt;150 configuration and status files (firewall rules, VPN sessions, certs, user DB, SNMP keys, full backups) from any Internet-facing FortiGate listening on 443 / 10443.  
• Stolen data would expose network topology, plaintext or lightly-encrypted passwords, live VPN &amp; IPSec session IDs, and SAML/RADIUS/LDAP creds, enabling lateral movement and identity spoofing deep inside victim networks.  
• Attackers could mass-scan and harvest devices with the tool’s built-in 20-thread bulk scanner, quickly building a credential trove for ransomware, espionage, or resale.  
• Price tag US $12 000 (escrow only) hints at a working 0-day; widespread adoption would parallel past FortiOS SSL-VPN exploits that seeded multiple ransomware campaigns.  
• Mitigations if no patch yet: block or ACL the API ports, disable remote admin, upgrade to the latest FortiOS (&gt; 7.2), and monitor logs for bursts of /api/v2/ requests from unfamiliar IPs.

This started in some of the Telegram channels we monitor but has now moved to more mainstream discussions. The timeline increased the conversation to 25 instances. (**edited**)

At this point, I'm providing this information as the product for sale has been verified and, if history repeats, this will follow the others, like the. Belsen Group incident.

4,Question about OneDrive to SharePoint Migrations using AvePoint Fly,r/msp,Witty-Rock-2489,1,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1lslgq7/question_about_onedrive_to_sharepoint_migrations/,"Hi All,

Has anyone had to utilize AvePoint Fly to perform a OneDrive for Business to SharePoint migration before?

I may need to utilize this tool for an employee that is currently storing about \~200 GB in their OneDrive for Business account and had a few questions.

  
**Questions**

* **Intra Tenant Migrations for O365 (Same Tenant):** Does AvePoint Fly support O365 to O365 migrations within the same tenant \[(e.g., Tenant A (test.com) to Tenant B (test.com)\]?
* **Object Based Licensing:** How does Object based pricing work? From what I am seeing, AvePoint classifies OneDrive and SharePoint as separate objects and it sounds like I would need (1) Object based license for OneDrive and (1) license for SharePoint for a total of (2) Object based licenses for the monthly subscription.
* **Migration Limitations:** If (2) Object based licenses are purchased for the month of July 2025, does that mean that an unlimited amount of migrations can be performed between SharePoint and OneDrive during this active subscription window?
* **Folder Structure:** Would the tool be able to mirror the SharePoint folder (destination) structure to OneDrive for Business (source) or would the folder structure in SharePoint need to be manually created?
* **Folder Mapping:** Does AvePoint Fly support flexible folder mappings such as the below prior to performing the data transfers?

**Examples**  
**OneDrive for Business (Folder A + B) to SharePoint Site #1 (Folder B)**

**OneDrive for Business (Folder C + D + E) to SharePoint Site #2 (Folder C)**

* **Permissions:** Will the preexisting permissions for the migrated OneDrive folders (source) be retained in SharePoint (destination)?
* **Metadata:** Will the current Metadata for the migrated OneDrive folders be retained after the migrations such as file version history and other useful attributes?
* **Excel Links:** Can the tool preserve any Excel links to other Workbooks? For example if Workbook A has a VLOOKUP linked to Workbook B, is it possible for this to be retained or would it need to be manually edited?
* **Incremental Migrations:** Has anyone had to perform an Incremental migration using the AvePoint Fly tool? Just wondering what would happen to the files in SharePoint (Destination) if files are being edited in OneDrive (Source).
* **Support:** Has anyone had to deal with AvePoint Support before. Just wondering what your experiences were like, whether good or bad as I know they have phone and email support."

Current home:
3600 sqft, 6 bed 4 bath.  Finished basement with living room.  Huge yard.  Have 200k in equity.  Very nice neighborhood but boring.  Mainly older ish crowd.  Sunsetting but not retired...this is a thing.  No kids in the neighborhood or others our age.  Have incredible views and homes are on big lots so no close neighbors.  Massive living room with 25' ceiling. 

Potential home:
2400 sqft. 5bed 3 bath.  In middle of social zone, amazing pool, amazing back yard with pergola- outdoor living area.  Very little yard.  

Pros of moving is obviously the pool and back yard, smaller yard so less upkeep, smaller house payment.  Closer to her friends.  More social area 
Cons of moving: smaller house, less living space. 

We arent lake river people.  Give me a heated saltwater pool all day long over a boat and a lake.  We would be about 1200-1500 less per month on a house payment.  Less property tax if we leave also.

However, we want to investigate if a single stickied post (like this one) to anchor polls and surveys.  The post could be a place for those who are interested in opportunities to give back and help students, researchers, new ventures, and others.

# Downsides:

There are downsides that we will continue to watch for.

* Polls and surveys could be too narrowly focused, to be of interest to the whole community.
* Others are ways for startups to indirectly do promotion, or gather data.
* In the worst case, they can be means to glean inappropriate data from working professionals.
* As mods, we cannot sufficiently warrant the data collection practices of surveys posted here. So caveat emptor, and act with caution.

Before he turned 3, I moved out of the house, and took him with me to my moms. My son’s mom is an alcoholic. We got back together about a year later, and once the drinking got bad again, I left again, with our son. He’s primarily been with me since he was 5. We never got lawyers involved. She would take him on weekends when he wasn’t in school. But occasionally I would have to go get him because she would be black out drunk by noon. She went to a mental health facility for a couple weeks and then into inpatient treatment, where she met her current boyfriend. When my son was 6, she decided to move across the country with her boyfriend so he could be closer to his kids. Our son stayed here with me in Washington. Snohomish County. 

Fast forward to this past February, my son and one of his older brothers (her middle son) flew together to go visit her for a long weekend. She was blackout drunk the entire time, said she wanted to kill herself, I had the middle son call the emts, they took her to the hospital, and my parents paid to have the boys fly back a couple days early. I had looked into getting a lawyer, and had 3 consultations, each stating they said I already had the power, she was out of state, I could put the kibosh on future visits, etc.

As a single dad, it is near impossible to do anything here in Washington. I rent a 1 bedroom MIL apartment from my friend, but my son’s mom is growing rapidly, and we are starting to get claustrophobic. I can’t afford a 2 bedroom anything around where we live. One of my best friends has an opportunity next year to take a job in San Antonio. I talked with my son, and he is super stoked for a new adventure, especially since his brothers have said they will come visit whenever they can, and we’d be able to fly back to visit family and friends a couple times a year. I work remote, and already have the go ahead to move.

My son’s mom has said they are strongly considering moving back, I told her our plans, and she said she would want to have him more and have a normal relationship with him. I said I was baffled that she would think that after leaving for a few years, and me being his safe places his security, his provider, that she thinks she would move back and just unravel all of that. She’s been sober, that I know of, since that last fiasco, but she’s unpredictable. If she goes off her meds, or her boyfriend leaves town for work, she could get triggered easily. 

Do I contact a lawyer and try to get it on paper that I am primary parent? Do I even need to go that route since she already made a choice to leave her kids behind when she moved out of state? And are there known to be lawyers that offer any sort of payment plan, as I don’t have thousands of dollars saved up to pay what I assume is going to be a huge fee?

TL:DR: my sons mom moved out of state when he was 6, next year I want to move out of our state, Washington, to start a new life, where we could have a better quality of life, and she’s talking about moving back, and I’m trying to find the best course of action that won’t derail this plan."

About a year ago, a small bobcat type of truck and 10 massive truckloads of dirt mixed with stones and sticks was dropped off at our neighbors house. Not only did the dirt encroach into our property, but it also covered the bottom boards of our fence. After this winter, we had a ridiculous amount of flooding from the snow melting. On our side, we decided to add in a rain garden. We dug 24 inches deep, added sand, pea gravel, dirt, plenty of water absorbing plants and decorative rock. I also changed the direction of the gutters on my garage so it flows away from the rain garden completely. Unfortunately we are still getting, at some points, up to 6-10 inches of standing water in our backyard, which also flows into our garage. We reached out to the city of Minneapolis, and they came out to look at the property. We found out that indeed, yes, the owner did not follow city rules and regulations, and had been fined. After a month, the owner has still not paid the fine, and the city informed us that it will be placed on the owners property taxes. We took from this that the owner, who owns several units around our neighborhood, couldn’t care less about the fine or our complaints to the city. Suffice to say, our garage, our rain garden and our backyard have been SAVAGED by standing water. Our sump pump has been running non stop. We finally snapped and reached out for legal help, and have hired a lawyer. We have dozens of pictures, several with a measuring tape in the water, along with clear runoff paths from their yard to ours and the standing water in our garage. The lawyer wants a retainer of $3000, and we are suing the owner for damages to the garage, which we will need assessed by a civil engineer, and either a permanent fix to their backyard following the city’s rules, or removal of all the dirt.

To be clear, we want a permanent fix, we aren’t trying to screw the guy over. We tried all other avenues, but still find ourselves anxious every time it rains. Are we doing the right thing? Is the retainer too much, or a good deal? Is hiring a civil engineer not needed? We want to trust the lawyer, but we have no clue what we are doing. Please help, any information would be amazing! I’ll answer any other follow up questions as soon as I can. TIA!!!

TLDR; lawyer wants $3,000 retainer to sue owner of the house (our neighbor) for damages to our property after assessment by a civil engineer. What do we need to know or be prepared for?!"

Here’s what I’m planning so far:
	•	I’ll use a poolish preferment, fermented for 24 hours at room temperature.
	•	Then I’ll mix a 65% hydration dough, bulk ferment briefly, then ball and cold ferment in the fridge.
	•	The dough balls will rest in the fridge for at least 12 hours, and be used up to 48 hours later.
	•	To minimize waste and always have dough ready, I’m considering baking the dough cold, straight from the fridge, without bringing it to room temperature.
	•	I plan to bake at 400°C (750°F) in a pizza oven.

My main question:
Will baking cold dough at that temperature still give me a nice crust with good bubbles/blistering? Or will it affect oven spring and texture negatively?

I’m a bit lost figuring out the best practice here, so any experience, tips, or corrections are welcome. Thanks! 🫠"
4,AI-Powered Local Intelligence Tool for Restaurant Growth,r/restaurant,cjsalva,0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/restaurant/comments/1lsobfw/aipowered_local_intelligence_tool_for_restaurant/,"**Hey restaurant owners, consultants, and marketers — I built something you might actually find useful.**

Over the past few months, I’ve been developing a desktop app originally designed for small business marketers. But I recently realized it’s surprisingly valuable for restaurants — especially if you're trying to grow, monitor competitors, or offer B2B services.

**It’s a local lead generation + competitive intelligence tool, powered by Google Maps, Bing, and AI.**  
You just type in something like **“pizza restaurants in Austin”**  and it pulls structured business and review data instantly.

**Here’s what it gives you:**

* Business name, address, phone, website, and social links
* Emails (when publicly available)
* Star ratings, review count, service categories
* Full review text for analysis
* Export to Excel, CSV, or JSON

**With an OpenAI or Gemini API key connected, it also:**

* Summarizes each restaurant in plain English
* Extracts key services or menu highlights
* Generates custom outreach messages (sales-y, friendly, whatever tone you need)

# Why it might be a game-changer for restaurants:

✅ **Analyze competitors** – See who’s dominating reviews and why  
✅ **Spot partnership opportunities** – Breweries, venues, caterers, food trucks  
✅ **Find weak spots** – Identify places with bad reviews or missing info and offer help  
✅ **Monitor your own reputation** – Or benchmark against others nearby  
✅ **Generate lead lists** – If you sell services like POS, cleaning, marketing, or consulting

**Bonus:**  
The app can instantly summarize hundreds of reviews using AI — so instead of reading 300+ reviews manually, you get clear insights like:

&gt;

**Not a SaaS. Not browser-based. Just a one-time install (Mac &amp; Windows) that runs on your machine and gives you rich, exportable business data — anywhere in the world.**

# Why I’m sharing this:

I’d love honest feedback from restaurant pros or consultants — how would *you* use structured business + review data like this?

Is it useful for outreach? Tracking the competition? Partnering with local businesses?

Happy to demo, answer questions, or hear what you’d want this tool to do better.

Let me know what you think — or if you're curious to try it out."
4,"I built a platform to connect your menu, orders, and marketing. Looking for owners to test it.",r/restaurant,Adham_Nasr,0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/restaurant/comments/1lrtsd5/i_built_a_platform_to_connect_your_menu_orders/,"Hello everyone,

I've spent a lot of time developing a platform called **Ripplefy**, and I'm hoping to get feedback from professionals in the restaurant industry.

I noticed that many independent restaurants have to piece together different tools—one for the waitlist, another for the online menu, a separate loyalty program, etc. They often don't talk to each other, which seems inefficient.

My project is an attempt to solve this by bringing these functions into a single, connected system. The idea is to make your technology work together.

Here are the core functions I've built:

* **A Connected Menu System:** It starts with an AI tool that helps build your digital menu from a photo or PDF. From there, you can edit prices or 86 items from one dashboard, and the changes apply everywhere, even across multiple branches.
* **Integrated Ordering &amp; Loyalty:** The system can generate QR codes for each table. This allows for direct ordering, and it's tied into features like a customer loyalty program that works seamlessly on-site.
* **Centralized Analytics:** All this activity—from orders to menu ratings—feeds into one analytics dashboard. The goal is to give you a clear, honest view of your sales trends, most popular dishes, and promotion performance without needing to check three different apps.

I'm now at the stage where I need real-world testing. We have not activated subscriptions, so I am offering **full access for free** to a group of early testers.

My goal is to learn from your expertise. I need to know what's genuinely useful in a real restaurant environment, what's confusing, and what's missing.

If you are interested in trying the platform and sharing your thoughts, you can access it here:

I’m an 18-year-old B.Tech student from India (Computer Science – AI &amp; Data Science), and I’m currently looking for a part-time Virtual Assistant job to support myself while I continue my studies.

I have no fancy degree or corporate resume — but what I offer is real hunger to grow, strong values, and a hardworking mindset. Even a few hours of remote work each day would mean a lot to me.

I’m not here to fake anything. I’ll handle even the most basic tasks with full focus and responsibility — because I genuinely want to learn, earn with dignity, and make your life easier.

🧠 Skills I’m Comfortable With:
	•	Administrative tasks: data entry, calendar management, research
	•	Google Workspace: Docs, Sheets, Forms, Drive organization
	•	Task tracking: Can use tools like Trello, Notion, or ClickUp (currently learning them)
	•	Inbox management &amp; basic customer support (replying, organizing, tagging)
	•	Social media support: scheduling posts, engaging with comments, caption drafting
	•	Online research: competitor analysis, lead generation, data mining
	•	Simple reporting: Making reports in Sheets or summarizing data clearly

🧾 What You’ll Get from Me:
	•	Strong work ethic, discipline, and honesty
	•	Daily communication and updates — I don’t disappear
	•	Flexible hours, timezone-friendly
	•	A young, trainable mind ready to grow with your brand

I’m especially looking to work with startups, creators, or solopreneurs who need a reliable right hand for the day-to-day stuff they don’t have time for. I’ll take ownership of small things so you can focus on big things.

Even a small monthly pay (~₹3000–₹5000 or $30–$60) would make a big difference for me. I’m not here just for money — I want to earn your trust and become an asset to your workflow.

If you’re reading this and think I could be a fit — or if you know someone hiring — please DM me or leave a comment.

4,Training Pathways Mapping,r/Training,Throwawaynumber8589,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Training/comments/1lra99v/training_pathways_mapping/,"Hi all, 

I work for a company where most of our staff work in multiple different roles in any given week/month.

In our LMS, we have hundreds of roles set up with X number of courses attached as training requirements. These roles then link to our scheduling software, so staff cannot be rostered for a shift doing Y role unless they meet all of the training requirements for it. 

We are able to easily pull reports on which courses are required on which roles, as well as whether X person meets all the training requirements for Y role. 

However we don’t currently record or display any information about the required order of course completion. Many of our courses are required on multiple roles, but they don’t always have the same prerequisites and/or next steps, depending on the role.

For example, Role A requires Course 1, 2, 3 and 4, in that order. But Role B requires Course 1 and 3 only, in that order. 

Everything always flows in the same direction though, so you’d never come across a role that requires Course 2 before Course 1, it’s just that some of the courses might be skipped. 

There also might be multiple branches off of one course, for example Role A might require Course 1, 2, 3 and 4, but Role C requires Course 1, 2, 5 and 6.

Our leadership/training staff need to be able to easily find out:
- What are the required courses for a role and what order should they be completed in? (ideally with links to the courses)
- If X person has completed Y course for Role A, which other roles branch out from Y course that X person could easily be cross-trained in?

Any ideas/suggestions?

Oh, and our LMS and reporting tools are both built in house, but our Software team is extremely under-resourced so it’s very unlikely they’ll be able to build anything new for us or make big changes to the existing system 🥲

We’ve considered solutions in Excel and Teams/Sharepoint but haven’t managed to come up with anything good yet.

Would love to hear how you’ve handled this issue, if anyone has??

I've been told by several coach friends that I'm a ""natural coach"" and I should really look into becoming a coach myself. When I reflect, I realize I've always been one of those people others gravitate to for advice, and I've always been someone who tries to inspire others, pump them up, help them achieve their goals, talk them through stuff, etc. I'm also one of those folks that strangers will come up to and tell me their life story, which is always kind of amusing. (When it happens, I kind of inwardly laugh, ""Here we go again,"" while I smile and nod.)

My dilemma is that I seem to be at a time of my life where I feel a bit burned out by the world and everyone in it, and my patience seems to be dwindling. For example, I have many friends who ask for my advice/guidance/help, yet when I try to give it, I get the ""Yes, but..."" excuses; all the billions reason why they CAN'T. Yes, they may just want to vent, but I'm so over it.

I'm currently a massage therapist, so seeing people one-on-one and supporting others is something I already do, but I'm concerned about this growing impatience I have with people who want to change but won't take the necessary steps. Some are my massage clients who complain about their health, ask my advice, yet never take action. I'm tired of having the same conversations repeatedly with them.(Or maybe, in my mid-50s, I'm just getting to be an old, grumpy fart? I wonder.)

I'm looking at long-range goals, and feel like coaching might be a good career shift since I'd still be helping others, yet it would be less taxing on my physical body the way massage therapy is. But on another level, am I too burned out?

Some of my coach friends says I can make a coaching biz into anything I want it to be, including only working with highly motivated people, or having a no-bullshit, scorched-Earth coaching method, but still, I'd like some input. Maybe a coach training program would address some of these impatience issues, and how to deal with that in a coaching practice? Many thanks in advance!

EDITED TO ADD:  
Yes, I am well aware that giving advice and inspiring others is not what a coach does; I'm not saying it is. I'm trying to give some insight into my present situation and maybe why coaches I know have suggested coaching."

At first, we sent everyone a template to copy and paste. That worked for a week, but then people started tweaking things or forgetting to update their info. We needed something easier and more scalable.

Eventually, we moved to a tool that integrates with Gmail and lets us apply the same HTML signature to everyone through Google Workspace. Now if we change something like the support number or run a short promo, we can update it for the whole team in one go.

The EU AI Act, Canada's AIDA, and the NIST AI RMF are all making it harder to follow the rules, and it's not just for big companies. If your AI system ranks candidates, handles user data, makes predictions, or controls who can use services, you are probably regarded as ""high-risk.""

3,Experience operating a shared kitchen?,r/Entrepreneur,moseeds,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1lu56rn/experience_operating_a_shared_kitchen/,"I used to run a small cafe which didn't work out well. Off the back of it we started supplying food products to other cafes and restaurants which then neccessitated a proper commercial kitchen premises to cook and pack from. I've finally found a premises and will be fitting it out.

However it occured to me the premises will lay dormant much of the time. There is a massive demand for decent commercial kitchen spaces (I know this because it took us over a year to find something suitable and affordable) and all the agents we spoke to said the same thing. 

I was then thinking I would like to pivot to offer a shared kitchen workspace monthly fee perhaps 3 months commitment. In return you'd get support with meeting food safety, security, access to equipment, a selected number of power sockets for your own equipment, a dedicated mailbox etc. 

Has anyone else done something like this? It's practically a dark kitchen but for smaller starting up scale food businesses. Is this a terrible idea (UK based) that you've tried and failed to make an impact with? If so why?

Any thoughts, feedback welcome!

3,"Totally lost and lonely, what's next?",r/Entrepreneur,ModernMadnesss,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1lu432w/totally_lost_and_lonely_whats_next/,"Hey Entrepreneurs,

How are you all doing?

The life of an entrepreneur is often lonely and to be honest, I'm feeling lonely and lost. I'm used to working solo a lot but I really prefer having someone with me on a journey, I said goodbye to many people around me because they were always negative about me working in the evenings, weekends and didn't support me for wanting to do it differently and not be stuck forever in a 9-5. But here I am, no longer having a clue what to do next. I'm used to the online world moving fast, I used to have so many ideas, I'm more skilled than ever, but yet nothing comes out. 

  
I'm quite ok with my current 9-5 job, but I want to spend my evenings and weekends working on something that generates a steady stream of income and keeps me going with that entrepreneur mindset. Sitting around doing nothing bores me more than anything.

If you got any ideas for me, you found any remote job application that could fit me, it would be great if you could leave a comment! I'm decent in sales (closed high ticket sales community) and know how to sell a solution/provide value, worked in marketing for the past 12 years with focus on strategy and SEO, technical skills (basic coding, infrastructure / SaaS framework setups, building websites, automations) and I did a bit of consultancy, in the jobs I had people would always involve me in many other different things and called me Jack of many trades, I know in some way that's a weakness too, because being extremely good in a specific skill can make you a good income.

Anyways, I just had to write this off me. Cheers!

pulled EVERY top conversation from each one

took me 30 fucking hours straight

then I spent another 15 hours analyzing the whole damn thing

and what I found will blow your mind...

people are DESPERATE to talk about specific some micro-niches

but there's literally NO ONE creating content about them

zero supply, massive demand

I created this insane demand/supply table that shows EXACTLY what people are craving

these micro-niche YouTube faceless channels are sitting there waiting to be monetized

we're talking about topics people are obsessing over but can't find ANYWHERE

the math that'll make you sick:

→ 1 micro-niche channel = $2K-$8K monthly

→ 5 channels = $10K-$40K monthly  
→ 10 channels = $20K-$80K monthly

while everyone's fighting over saturated niches like ""online business""

you could dominate completely untapped markets

I'm talking about specific problems people discuss every single day but NO ONE is solving

this isn't some theoretical bullshit

this is pure data-driven opportunity sitting in front of you

the people already TOLD me what they want

I just had to listen to 147 communities worth of conversations

if you want this list of guaranteed micro-niches that are literally begging for content creators...

DM me ""NICHES"" and upvote this post

I'll send you the complete analysis + the exact topics people are obsessing over

stop guessing what people want

start giving them exactly what they're already asking for

the opportunity window is maybe 2-3 weeks before everyone catches on

✅ Automatically send confirmation emails  
✅ Download signed waivers anytime

It’s intentionally minimal — designed to be fast, simple, and not overwhelming.  
Still early days, but it’s live and working.

I'm about to launch my startup app called AIOMarketApp — a marketplace platform that combines real estate listings, product selling, and food ordering, all in one.

The platform is open to three main groups:

Realtors/Agents (uploading properties)

Sellers (selling products)

Food Vendors (offering meals for delivery/pickup)


I’m trying to finalize subscription pricing and tiers before launch, and I’d really appreciate input on:

1. How many subscription tiers would make sense per group?


2. What’s a good monthly price range for each group, considering it's a new app and I want adoption?


3. Should pricing be based on number of listings, visibility/boosts, features (like chat support, analytics, promotion), or a combo of all?


4. Any examples from similar platforms you’ve seen or built?



Right now, I’m thinking something like:

Free tier with limited listings or features.

Basic tier with more uploads and visibility.

Pro/Premium tier with full access, promo boosts, maybe early access to users/customers.


But I’m torn between offering 2 tiers vs 3, and figuring out the right pricing that’s attractive but still helps the platform grow sustainably.

If you’ve worked on a marketplace or have thoughts on monetization for multi-role platforms like this, I’d love your feedback.

Thanks in advance!"

3,"Our company is ranking on chatgpt, claude and grok, here’s what we updated",r/DigitalMarketingHelp,goudgirls,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalMarketingHelp/comments/1lmjtlr/our_company_is_ranking_on_chatgpt_claude_and_grok/,"not sure if this’ll help anyone but figured i’d share.

so a few months back, we noticed something weird

clients suddenly started saying:

“i found you guys on chatgpt, Grok suggested me, AI recommended me”

and that’s when it clicked.

Our team then updated our calendar page with AI option 2 months ago, and we were shocked to see 30% of the people who scheduled a meeting put ""AI recommended"" option.

AI search is the new SEO, we at Offshore Wolf gave it a fancy name, we call it LMO - Language Model Optimization, nobody's talking about it yet, so just wanted to share what we changed to rank.

here’s how we started ranking across *all* the big LLMs: chatgpt, claude, grok

\#1 We started contributing on communities

Every like, comment, share, links to our website increased the number of meetings we get from AI SEO,

so we heavily started contributing on platforms like quora, reddit, medium and the result? Way more organic meetings - all for free.

\#2 We wrote content like we were talking to AI

* clear descriptions of what we do
* mentioned our brand + keywords in natural language
* added tons of Q&amp;A-style content (like FAQs, but smarter)
* gave context LLMs can latch onto: who we help, what we solve, how we’re different

\#3 we posted content designed for AI memory

we used to post for humans scrolling.

now we post for AI

stuff like:

* Reddit posts that mention our brand + niche keywords (this post helps AI too)
* Twitter threads with full company name + positioning
* guest posts on forums and blogs that ChatGPT scans

we planted seeds across the internet so LLMs could connect the dots.

\#4 we answered questions before people even asked them

on our site and socials, we added things like:

* “What companies provide VAs for under $500 a month?”
* “How much do VAs cost in 2025?”
* “Who are the top remote hiring platforms?”

turns oout, when enough people see that kind of language, AI starts using it too.

\#5. we stopped chasing google, we started building trust with LLMs

our Marketing Manager says, Google SEO will be cooked in 5-10 years

its crazy to see chatgpt usage growth, in the past 1/2 years, there's some people who now use chatgpt for everything, like a personal advisor or assistant

to rank, we created:

* comparison tables
* real testimonials (worded like natural convos)
* super clear “who we’re for / who we’re not for” copy

LLMs *love* clarity.

tl,dr

We stopped writing for *Google.*

We started writing for *GPTs.*

Now when someone asks:

“Who’s the best VA company under $500/month full time?”

We come up 50% of the time.

We have asked our team members in Ukraine, Philippines, India, Nepal to try searching, with cookies disabled, VPN, and from new browsers, we come up,

Thank you for staying till the end.

Happy to make a part 2 including a LMO content calendar that we use at our company.

—--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Hope you guys don’t mind us plugging u/offshorewolf here as reddit backlinks are valued massively in AI SEO, but if anyone here is interested to hire an affordable english speaking assistant for $99/week full time then do visit our website."

I wanted to share something that's been a huge learning curve for me recently, and I bet many of you can relate.
When I decided to launch my first digital product, I was SO excited. I put in all the work creating it, convinced it was genuinely helpful.
Then came the launch.
And... crickets. 🦗

Seriously, it felt like I was screaming into an empty room. I had practically zero followers on social media, no big email list, and no idea how to get my product in front of anyone who actually needed it. I saw all these other creators with thousands of followers making sales, and I just felt stuck and invisible

I spent days (and nights!) feeling frustrated, searching for answers. Everything online seemed to suggest I needed to become a huge influencer first, or spend a ton on ads – neither of which felt possible for me.

But I refused to give up. I started experimenting with really simple, direct tactics. I talked to friends about it, joined very specific online communities, and tried to understand exactly where my ideal buyers were actually looking for solutions like mine.
And you know what? It finally happened.
I got my first sale. 🎉 

It wasn't because I suddenly went viral or got thousands of followers overnight. It was because I focused on connecting directly with just a few right people and providing clear value.

This whole experience completely changed my perspective. You really don't need a huge audience to get started. You just need to know where to look and how to approach those first few buyers authentically.

I'm still very much on this journey, but I wanted to share this discovery. If you're feeling stuck and invisible like I was, remember it is absolutely possible to get those first sales."

I’m a freelance marketer and content writer, and I’ve been using AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) heavily in my day-to-day work. Over time, I developed a structured prompt workflow to help me plan campaigns, write briefs, create strategy outlines, and generate content faster and more consistently.

I recently built a public prompt library with 20 detailed, variable-based marketing prompts. These cover things like funnel design, SEO, content calendars, retargeting ads, UGC campaigns, and more.

I figured I’d share it in case it’s useful to others—it’s free to access and use.

3,CryoCan - A New Benchmark in LN₂ Storage Solutions,r/MarketingHelp,Best_Technology_7833,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingHelp/comments/1lpwouk/cryocan_a_new_benchmark_in_ln₂_storage_solutions/,"Cryolab has launched the CryoCan series, a next-generation liquid nitrogen (LN₂) dewar designed for the long-term preservation of biological samples. Engineered for reliability, portability, and temperature stability, the new model aims to raise the standard for cryogenic storage across laboratories, fertility clinics, and medical research facilities.

The CryoCan 30-6 features a 30-litre capacity and comes equipped with six precision-engineered round canisters, enabling the safe and organized storage of sensitive biological materials such as cell cultures, reproductive samples, and clinical specimens. Despite its storage volume, the unit maintains a lightweight and compact design (681 mm tall and 451 mm wide), making it suitable for use in high-demand environments where space and mobility are essential.

One of the key differentiators of the CryoCan 30-6 is its market-leading holding time, providing users with exceptional temperature retention and reduced LN₂ consumption. This efficiency translates to cost savings and enhanced sample security, especially in settings where long-term viability is mission critical.

**Expanding the CryoCan Range**

In addition to the 30-6 model, Cryolab continues to serve broader storage needs with expanded offerings in its CryoCan lineup:

**CryoCan 47-6**: A larger 47-litre unit that includes six round canisters, maintaining the same high-performance insulation and ergonomic features as the 30-6.

**CryoCan 47-10**: Also, a 47-litre model, this version is optimized for labs requiring greater sample organization, incorporating ten canisters within the same durable frame.

All CryoCan vessels are designed with user experience and long-term durability in mind, featuring robust construction, excellent thermal insulation, and an intuitive canister system for sample access and management.

**Meeting the Demands of Modern Laboratories**

Our goal with the CryoCan 30-6 was to provide a solution that’s not only reliable and space-efficient but also adaptable to the evolving needs of today’s scientific and medical professionals. “Whether you're operating a fertility clinic, a biotech startup, or a university research lab, the CryoCan series delivers performance and peace of mind.”

**Availability**

[The CryoCan 30-6 and other models in the CryoCan range are now available for order via our website. For more information, technical specifications, or to request a quote, visit www.cryolab.co.uk or contact the Cryolab sales team directly.](http://www.cryolab.co.uk/)

**About Cryolab**

A few issues I’m running into:

* **Indexing problems**: Many pages aren’t getting indexed. Most of the content is JavaScript-rendered with minimal raw HTML... Could Google be seeing it as thin?
* **Short-lived content**: I considered adding match previews to improve content depth, but since they’re only useful for a couple of days, are they even worth doing from an SEO perspective? And should they go on a separate page or the fixture page?

Some positives: I get around 4K monthly users (mainly from socials and returning visitors), and time on site is decent users seem to explore multiple pages.

Would love any thoughts on:

* How to improve indexing for JavaScript-heavy sites (My DA is 0.6)
* Whether short-lived content like previews actually helps SEO or pointless as the big sites take up this search space.

3,Automation to Save Typeform Responses to Google Sheets + Slack Alerts,r/MarketingHelp,Accurate_Daikon_5913,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingHelp/comments/1lp515k/automation_to_save_typeform_responses_to_google/,"

Hey everyone 👋

I’ve seen a lot of freelancers, agencies, and consultants miss out on new clients just because leads slip through the cracks—especially when someone fills out a Typeform but no one notices the email notification.

I put together a plug-and-play automation template that does 3 things automatically:

✅ Instantly saves each Typeform response to a Google Sheets CRM
✅ Sends a formatted Slack message so your team can reply faster
✅ Helps you track and organize every lead in one place

It takes about 10 minutes to set up (no coding), and you can customize it however you like.

If you’re interested in:

Never losing another warm lead

Responding to inquiries faster

Having a clean spreadsheet of all prospects

…I’m happy to share the template + instructions or answer any questions.

Just drop a comment or DM me, and I’ll send you the details!

✅ No hard pitch here—just sharing something that’s helped a lot of small businesses and agencies I work with.

Stay productive out there! 🚀

3,Selling to trades B2B,r/MarketingHelp,clan2424,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingHelp/comments/1los0v3/selling_to_trades_b2b/,"If you had 20 k to invest to sell a service to trades businesses, real estate, restaurants, etc, what would you put the 20 k towards? Is this enough?

To get more specific, my business basically sells automations to make businesses more efficient. The goal is to help these businesses spend the majority of their time doing THEIR job, not extracurricular stuff. So for example, a plumber should be plumbing not handling customer service.

Our main automation is an AI receptionist that sounds human. It sounds like bullshit, but when you give it a call at 617-329-4199, you’ll understand how awesome and useful it is. This helps companies grow by not even needing an office. More tradesmen get hired and the business continues to flourish.

3,"CBS High Security Vitrification Kits: Closed System, Maximum Safety",r/MarketingHelp,Best_Technology_7833,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingHelp/comments/1llvmxk/cbs_high_security_vitrification_kits_closed/,"In the evolving field of assisted reproductive technology (ART), safety, precision, and reliability are critical when it comes to cryopreservation. With increased demand for secure embryo and oocyte storage, the CBS High Security Vitrification Kits by Cryo Bio System represent a major advancement in vitrification protocols. These kits provide an effective, closed-system solution for safeguarding reproductive cells under ultra-low temperature storage conditions.

Unlike traditional open systems, which expose biological material directly to liquid nitrogen, the CBS High Security Vitrification Kits are designed to eliminate this risk. At the heart of the system is a high security ionomeric resin straw that offers a hermetically sealed environment. This resin material is specifically engineered for long-term storage and maintains its integrity even at cryogenic temperatures, ensuring the preservation of sensitive biological samples.

The kit is composed of three integrated components. First, the ionomeric resin straw forms the main body of the system, providing a durable, sterile chamber for the vitrified sample. Second, a capillary tube with a pre-formed gutter is co-injected with a coloured handling rod. This colour-coding is not just a practical enhancement for visual identification—it also supports error-free sample tracking and management in high-throughput laboratory settings. Finally, the blue plastic insertion device ensures precise and consistent placement of the sample into the straw, simplifying the loading process and reducing variability between operators.

Compatibility is a key advantage of the CBS vitrification system. The kits are fully compatible with both Vit Kit and Vit Kit-NX media, allowing fertility clinics and laboratories to incorporate them into existing vitrification protocols without the need for significant retraining or additional validation steps. This makes the adoption of the system straightforward for teams already using standard vitrification solutions.

From a regulatory standpoint, CBS High Security Vitrification Kits meet the highest international standards. They are CE-marked, ensuring compliance with European Union regulations for medical devices, and they are FDA 510(k) Cleared, making them approved for use within the United States. These certifications reflect the system’s high level of safety, efficacy, and quality assurance.

[In addition to performance and compliance, the kits are available in a variety of colours, adding a layer of visual organization for managing large numbers of specimens. Whether used in IVF laboratories, academic research facilities, or tissue banks, this simple yet effective feature contributes to better workflow efficiency and reduced risk of mix-ups.](https://cryolab.co.uk/product/cbs-high-security-vitrification-kits-various-colours/7)

[As reproductive medicine continues to progress, the importance of secure, standardized, and high-quality cryopreservation tools cannot be overstated. The CBS High Security Vitrification Kits address these needs with a product that prioritizes both safety and usability. Their closed system design, combined with user-friendly features and robust regulatory backing, makes them a compelling choice for any laboratory focused on excellence in reproductive cryotechnology.](https://cryolab.co.uk/product/cbs-high-security-vitrification-kits-various-colours/7)

3,Is Media Mister a Scam or Legit? Here's What I Found After 3 Orders,r/MarketingHelp,daddyatthedoor,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingHelp/comments/1lg1ufl/is_media_mister_a_scam_or_legit_heres_what_i/,"When I first found Media Mister, I wasn't sure if I should trust it. There are tons of websites offering social media services, and honestly, most of them seem shady.

I didn't want to risk my accounts or waste money, but I also needed something to help boost visibility on a few platforms I've been working on.

Over the last few months, I placed three different orders with Media Mister, each for a different platform, and here's exactly how it went:

Order #1 - Instagram Followers

I started small with an Instagram followers package. The delivery was gradual, not instant, which made it look more organic. The followers looked legit and actually stayed. What surprised me was that after that, I started getting more engagement on newer posts. Not a huge spike, but enough to feel like the boost helped.

Order #2 - Spotify Plays

I had a new track I'd uploaded that wasn't getting much traction. I tried a plays package just to see if it would help push it. The results were solid, the plays came in smoothly and stayed consistent. I even got some saves and a few new listeners afterward, which hadn't happened before.

Order #3 - YouTube Subscribers

This one made me a little nervous, but I gave it a shot. The subscribers came through steadily over a few days. No issues, no drops. My channel started looking more legit, and I noticed slightly better reach on recent videos. What I liked most was how smooth the whole process was. Everything was delivered as promised, with no funny business or sketchy stuff. You don't get that with every site.

So if you're wondering whether [Media Mister ](https://www.mediamister.com/#a_aid=2022&amp;chan=LSfFP) is a scam, my answer is no. Based on three different orders, across different platforms, they've been reliable and delivered real results every time. If you're thinking of trying it, I'd say start small like I did and see for yourself. But for me, it's been one of the few sites that actually works."
3,Psychospiritual Biz Coach Advice,r/SmallBusinessOwners,Extra-Lake1047,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmallBusinessOwners/comments/1lsstyh/psychospiritual_biz_coach_advice/,"Hello! I am new to this small business community and thought I would share my biggest piece of advice. When trying to succeed with your small business... there are 3 levels you must be working with:

  
1) Spiritual: This can look different for everyone, but essentially means being deeply connected to what you are doing and ensuring that your ventures are truely aligned with your values and what you came here to do. You can use your Astrology or Human Design charts to help with this if you are into that (and are what have helped my hundreds of clients over the years), but you can also just do a deep dive into your values and what you truely care about in life to help uncover some of this.

2) Psychological: You must do self analyse to see if your beliefs are actually congruent with achieving your goals. For example; you may have a desire to build have a thriving small business, but have a subconscious belief that success is hard to hold. This will block you! You must identify and clear these beliefs. Hypnosis and parts work is what I use and have found to be the most effective.

3) Business: People often either hyper focus on business and forget the spiritual and psychological, or completely forget that to be in business, at any scale, you have to learn business! This means creating a business plan, doing market research, learning sales and marketing. You can't just have an idea, put yourself out there, and think you will succeed. You need to learn what works, how to position yourself, who your competitors are... If you want a proper business, you need to do proper business work!

I hope this helps you :) "
3,Do product videos actually help increase,r/SmallBusinessOwners,Agile_Juggernaut_502,9,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmallBusinessOwners/comments/1ln17r9/do_product_videos_actually_help_increase/,"I keep going back and forth on whether product videos are worth the extra effort. I know everyone says video converts better, but I’ve seen stores do fine without them too. I’m not talking full-blown cinematic ads, more like short clips showing the product in use, maybe with a bit of voiceover or captions.

The thing is, I sell a few items that could probably benefit from some visual explanation. Stuff that doesn’t photograph well flat, or has a function that makes more sense when you see it in action. A few of them I stumbled on while digging through supplier directories on Alibaba, and even those listings had rough little demo clips. That made me think… if the suppliers are doing it, maybe I should too?

That said, it’s just another task on the pile. Filming, editing, formatting for different platforms, it adds up.

For those of you who’ve tested it, did you notice a real bump in conversion? Or is it just one of those things that feels important but doesn’t move the needle much?

Would love to hear real examples of whether it helped or not. Especially curious how it performed on product pages vs ads."
3,Would you use a tool that posts smarter,r/SmallBusinessOwners,noah-sheldon,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmallBusinessOwners/comments/1lgj9at/would_you_use_a_tool_that_posts_smarter/,"Would you use a tool that helps you post smarter across all your social platforms?

I am currently building a tool in public. This helps connect unlimited social accounts on various platforms. We also have a provision to tune each connected account for which audience it targets targeting which time zone and which language to generate captions for. So there is a lot of fine tuning you can do for each account. There are also brand AI settings where you can set your brand personality. All this is used for fine tuning the AI which generates captions and suggests time for you.

The idea is global distribution to distribute your organic content globally not just to a single audience but to specific audiences for each account across the globe in their own language at their own time.

Currently the app is in beta testing and will be launched soon in 10 days.

I am wondering if anyone is interested in connecting accounts ranging from Facebook Instagram TikTok Pinterest LinkedIn and configuring their settings for each account so that the AI can suggest better captions and times. With one click you will be able to generate captions and the AI will give you the time as well.

We also have a feature called Brand Space where you can group different social accounts for different brands so that your workflow is simplified and there is not much clutter. You can also invite your colleagues to your Brand Spaces.

I would love to hear if someone is even interested in this so that I can build it according to your needs and price it the cheapest in the market.

3,I Tried to Retire. Then I caught a Tiger,r/SmallBusinessOwners,YamGroundbreaking478,4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmallBusinessOwners/comments/1lfc6ta/i_tried_to_retire_then_i_caught_a_tiger/,"Something happened to me. I don’t know if I was born this way or if it came from some buried psychological trigger, but the fact remains: I like selling things. I like being useful to others—maybe more than most. But I’ve never been the loudest guy in the room.

If I had to be honest, it’s not just the selling. It’s the *hunt*. Hunting is most fun when you’re successful. Sure, being outdoors is nice—the breeze, the trees, the sights and sounds. But really? I’m just trying to get into position to *close*. To make the shot. To *win*.

You’ve probably guessed by now—I’m a founder. SaaS. Like so many others. I won’t name the company. This isn’t a plug.

But I’m not a *normal* founder. I’m 40, I have three amazing kids, and I live on a farm in the middle of the country—miles away from the glossy coasts and VC brunches.

A few years ago, my son got sick. Pre-COVID. My contract was up at work, and we packed up and left the city. We bought land. We built a life. Family. Farming. It felt safer, more controlled. My son got better.

But something else happened.

I got *bored*.

I started helping a buddy with his farm—soybeans, corn, rice. It wasn’t about the money, it was about *motion*. Big tractors. Bigger weather. I dug ditches, froze my fingers off, sweated through shirts. And it felt *real*. Especially when I was learning something new or pushing my body to do more than sit behind a laptop.

Three years passed.

Then one day, an old oilfield friend called. He sounded defeated. “I hate my job,” he said.

Me being me? I said: “Then let’s build something better.”

We kicked ideas around for a couple hours—where to work, what we could offer. That lasted maybe 120 minutes before I realized: nothing had changed. Not in the industry. Not in the conversations. It was like stepping back into the same old trap.

So I did what any semi-retired, slightly manic, ex-oilfield guy with a sales itch would do.

I called my girlfriend and said, “Come over. I’m going to feed you champagne and OJ while I pace around and write like a maniac.”

She showed up. It was a blast. Two days of ideas, scribbled notes, and sugar-high strategy.

That Sunday night, she went home. I passed out.

At 4 a.m., I woke up to the sound of rushing water. My house was flooding—torrential rain had turned my quiet farm into a nightmare. By the time the water reached 12 inches inside, I knew retirement was officially over.

Screw it. Time to go.

I packed up and drove to the lodge I’d built for duck hunting. Stayed there for five days. Barely ate. Slept a little. Focused a lot. Manic? Maybe. But it felt more like clarity.

Then I got online.

I’d kept my old B2B audience—ex-colleagues, former clients. Oilfield folks.

**So I told them: this is how we’re going to do sales now.**  
I geofenced their offices. And their bosses.  
Deployed around $2K in direct, precision-targeted messaging.  
""This,"" I said, ""is the future.""

And now? It *is*.

We deployed messaging to five companies like a Trojan horse. It took three months. We started working for two of them. Then three.

And guess what? It worked. It *worked* for them.

As a founder, I helped fix the problem that’s plagued this space forever: how to reach clients about specific tools and services *right when they’re in a position to buy*.

Here’s where it gets good:  
Now that one of them does it? The others *have to*, or they lose seller visibility.

I’ve got a *tiger by the tail*.

And the thing about tigers?  
They *bite*—a lot.

So here I am, reasoning out my next move while writing this post.  
Thinking about how to get this market under control.  
How to blitzscale into the chaos and fix what has always been broken in oilfield services.

Most oilfield sales guys? Experts in *adjectives*.  
They don’t deploy real tech.  
Just upgraded spreadsheets and PowerPoints recycled since Office ‘97.

It’s one of the most inefficient, backward industries on Earth.  
Billions in EBITDA. Zero tech adoption.  
The old guard likes it that way.

We haven’t started fundraising yet—aside from one massive geostrategy I ran at MidCon VC that landed us some incredible advisors.

It’s just two of us right now. Me and a CTO. That’s it.

Every dollar we bring in? Goes to product.  
No fluff. No headcount. No distractions.

But now this tiger’s starting to growl.

I’m sitting here with real revenue—$68K MRR—in under a year.  
A couple publicly traded companies already on board.  
And a market so damn slow to change that it’s ripe for the taking.

So what do we need?

A partner?  
A sales team?  
Funding?

Maybe all three.

I’ve been talking to many small business owners lately and noticed how hard it can be to consistently get solid leads, especially without spending a fortune on ads.

I’ve got two friends who specialize in email marketing and CRM, and they’ve been helping a few people I know grow their customer base *without* all the usual fluff or hard sells. Nothing shady, no sign-ups, no weird strings attached — they just genuinely know how to bring in leads through smart email strategy and customer follow-ups.

If anyone here’s been struggling with growth or wants to explore how email/CRM could bring in more business, give me a DM with your number and I’ll connect you. Totally up to you — just thought I’d share since it’s been super helpful for others in my circle."

I'm working on a small automation to compare client orders with supplier confirmations and flag discrepancies. I'm not a dev, just using some Python and Gemma (locally installed) for the logic.

The Process: I have a Python script that pulls all emails from the current day.

* It extracts the order number from the customer's message.
* For the confirmation, it extracts the text from a PDF and grabs the corresponding order number.
* If two matching numbers are found, the script sends both extracted texts along with a prompt to Gemma (locally installed) to validate them.
* At the end, I get a response in JSON format.

The issue: when I intentionally enter wrong info (like changing the client's name from Lius to Dius), Gemma doesn't catch it. I'm feeding it both documents and asking it to compare key details like name, address, product length, color, etc.

Has anyone used Gemma for validation tasks like this? Is 3n better at catching subtle mismatches?  
Also: Gemma often struggles to give me valid JSON back — so I tried to get a simple text as a answer and converting it later with python to json.

Any help would be much appreciated!"
3,Curious if any agencies offering services thru an iPaas-like offering and how is it working out?,r/automation,Lynx914,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1ltli4l/curious_if_any_agencies_offering_services_thru_an/,"Looking to get feedback and insight from agency owners, or automation specialists, that provide automation development and building services to businesses.

Currently I handle several businesses that I offer services to that vary across systems like Make, Zapier, and n8n. However, I'm really starting to want to offer and manage services thru my own managed platform as the juggling of access, credentials, and in some cases separate n8n instances clients, is becoming a real pain. I know some slightly larger agencies use services via offerings of Enterprise licenses to simply do an integrated setup, therefore making it easier to manage flows and client setups. I know obviously the cost is night and day, but the cost in comparison to what I charge is well worth it and would allow me to scale a bit more comfortably.

Despite me selling the idea to myself, I'm wondering if anyone has gone through or currently offers a similar type of setup for their clients, and if so, how is it working so far for you? Is it a hassle? Has it been a godsend? Etc. I'm looking to offer services using n8n embed, as I've gotten way down the rabbit hole using it for a number of setups and even building out custom nodes as needed.

AutoHotkey (AHK) sadly no longer works reliably in Windows 11 — devs have confirmed it. I loved using it for years, but glitches, lost characters, and interface issues finally pushed me to build an alternative.

💡 Introducing **TISK - Text Insert Short-Keys** — a lightweight, browser-based text insertion system using Tampermonkey. It allows you to define powerful shortcuts that work directly inside input fields in Chrome/Firefox.

✨ Features:

* Fast, expandable shortcuts (with custom group logic)
* Works inside any browser text field
* A compact but complete UI panel
* Excel-based shortcut editor (AHK script converter included)
* Fully offline and private — no external servers or APIs
* Group logic to allow you manage it easier
* and much more

🧰 Built with: JavaScript (Tampermonkey) + Excel VBA backend

✅ Why use it?

AHK stopped working for me in Win 11. TISK fills that gap — and even complements AHK if it still works for you.

Would love your feedback, ideas, or contributions!

Secondly - does anyone have any review sites API recommendations? The ones I’ve seen are designed for you to use to monitor and manage your own business reviews, not scrape data on other businesses. It needs to include Facebook, Trustpilot, Google reviews, yell etc. 

Lastly - I’m a non dev CTO so whilst very technical I’m not a coder. If anyone UK based is interested in building this with me, maybe you could use this yourself, let me know and we can work on it together. 2 heads are better than one. "

3,Questions about market fit and lead generation for starting my own consultancy in DS/ML space,r/consulting,Dapper-Kitchen-6225,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1lsrr35/questions_about_market_fit_and_lead_generation/,"**Tl;dr**: Thinking about going it alone as a consultant, and looking for some advice/reality checks. I’ve been a consultant before on the technical side, but top of funnel sales is new to me. (Also apologies if this isn't the best subreddit to post on, I'm new here. Feel free to redirect me if so).

**More context**: a group of friends (Data Scientists, ML Engineers and Software Engineers) would essentially like to find consulting projects to do on the side, and go full time if we get enough business. We work at 2^(nd) tier companies (non-FAANG tech or big non-tech companies) and we’re lead engineers or above with \~10 to 15 years of experience. I’ve been a technical architect at a consulting company, where I designed solutions and led implementation, so I'm comfortable with what happens after getting a lead and initial discussions. I realize I have a lot of questions, if you’re able to provide any insight on any one question individually even it would be greatly appreciated, as I'm trying to decide if this is a pipe dream or not.

* While we have established brands on our resume (i.e. companies we’ve worked at), we would be starting a new consultancy, so no brand and no success stories (not even a website at this point). This will obviously be a challenge, but is it insurmountable? For which customers would this not be a deal breaker?
* Does the following market fit make any sense: my thinking is that we’ll be very competitive on price compared to major consultancies, but our customers would still be getting top notch technical skills. Some people want the best (or at least the best brand) and will pay for it – we can’t compete for them. Some will be focused on getting really inexpensive services, and they’re going to be looking for outsourced developers. But I’m thinking there’s a middle ground, where we’re attractive because you can get excellent developers, same time zone and no culture/language barrier, but a lot less expensive than elite consultancies. Am I being delusional?
* For pricing, I was thinking of charging somewhere around $150-$200/hour. Does that more or less fit with the market segment I described above?
* How much of a deal-breaker would it be that we have day jobs? Obviously we won’t consider projects where there’s a conflict of interest, but I imagine a significant percent of potential customers are going to immediately say no to not being able to dedicate 100% of time to the work. My hope is that it’s context/project dependent, and we can still find work that we can do part time.
* I’m quite new to the lead generation aspect of this. I’m trying to figure out who to reach out to, and how, for data science/machine learning projects. If this is answered already elsewhere, feel free to redirect me. I’m trying to decide:
   * Which level should I reach out to? (director, VP, CTO, etc)
   * Which departments? (Marketing, analytics, engineering etc)
   * Which medium? (Someone recommended buying email lists from Zoominfo or sending InMails on LinkedIn)
   * Which kinds of companies would be most open to this? (I realize this is a tough one to answer, it depends. But any rules of thumb would help.)"
3,Software for online teacher and student to keep track of lessons owed?,r/freelance,flying-benedictus,12,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1lt9fvq/software_for_online_teacher_and_student_to_keep/,"
I work as an online freelance teacher. In most cases, students buy a package of lessons and then we book the lessons, either at the end of a lesson or using calendly. I currently keep track of the number of lessons I owe them by adding a counter in the events in google calendar. In the cases where they owe me, the counter is negative.

But the students don't have access to this counter. And sometimes there may be subtle misunderstandings about the counter. For instance, a student cancels in the last moment and they aren't aware that I have a 72h cancelling policy (because they haven't read my terms of service) so they think the lesson isn't spent. Or somtimes it's a parent paying, teenagers forget lessons... I can send emails informing of the state of the counter but would look a bit weird.

I'd like to have some kind of portal where I log this, and students can see their lesson saldo, how it's recharged by certain invoices, how it's spent by certain agreed dates, etc. Is there an easy out of the box solution for this that I could install in a lightweight server or using the cloud?

Otherwise I could use a shared google calc sheet for each student, but it feels a bit more hackey solution.

My current job is fine, but I am the only analyst in my division and I feel my role has plateaued in recent times - I live inside Power BI making small changes to the same dashboards for a leadership that has little to no understanding of the nuances of data analytics.

I have the go ahead to upgrade the a more costly license but am withholding on that until i can figure out if JIRA is even the right tool for the job here.

I am trying to update a previously created playlist using the shortcuts app. I want to avoid having to create the same playlist again and again but instead update an existing one replacing all the 25 songs on it with 25 new ones.

I want to achieve this so that I can automatically sync the same playlist to my apple watch without having to manually add the playlist to the watch every time I update it.

I tweaked another workflow so it picks 25 random songs played anytime before the last three months. That itself is working like intended. I simply want to have the same workflow update the newly created playlist instead of creating a new one (I am aware that I have to get rid of the first action in this case).

I've tried removing the Create Playlist action but if I run the workflow, it add 25 songs to the existing one instead of replacing them.

I’m integrating 8x8 for an American business that sends transactional SMS only (e.g., “Your project is complete,” job-workflow alerts). Absolutely no marketing blasts. We already use the Connect panel and can deliver SMS worldwide, just not to US numbers.

What I’ve done so far

* Opened ticket and supplied everything requested (company profile, HQ country, monthly volume &lt; 3 k, contact info, failed message ID etc.).
* Re-stated traffic is low-volume transactional; content + opt-out language provided.
* Confirmed we can send via API/Connect to non-US destinations without issue.
* Asked for a same-day call; was told they’re “at capacity” and to wait for sales.
* Keep getting the canned reply: “Choose 10DLC, Short Code, or Toll-Free; fill the onboarding form; our sales team will call.” No pricing table, no form link, no ETA.

Current roadblock

Account isn’t “fully onboarded,” no routing to US. Support won’t clarify the exact onboarding steps or send the required docs.

My questions to anyone who’s been through this:

1. What do I actually need to do (docs, forms, fees) to get 10DLC, Short Code, or Toll-Free enabled with 8x8?
2. What was the actual step-by-step you followed to get 10DLC or Toll-Free approved with 8x8?
3. Did you have to register your own brand + campaign in The Campaign Registry first, or does 8x8 handle that once you submit a form?

Some of these services even have internal APIs that do this (not sure how they monitor them but I would assume they check for origin or something to see if people are using it outside of their “allowed context)

3,Cynomi purchasing experience: important thing to note for MSPs considering this product for vCISO or Compliance as a Service,r/msp,JohnSnyderNFI,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1lu2ks7/cynomi_purchasing_experience_important_thing_to/,"There are 2 ways to purchase Cynomi right now, and I made the mistake of purchasing Cynomi through both pathways only to find that this creates some problems. Hopefully other MSPs will read this before buying and avoid the confusion I stumbled into. TL;DR: you should only buy Cynomi either through direct purchase from Cynomi or through Pax8, but you cannot do both.

Option 1: Buy directly from a Cynomi sales rep. This requires signing an agreement that commits you to purchasing a minimum quantity for a 1-year minimum term, paid in monthly installments. The sales experience is pleasant, informative, and relatively straightforward. The biggest hurdle is that you have to commit to a minimum seat count of 6 (you can likely talk your sales guy down to a lower number), which is an $18k/year commit at $3k/seat. Bonus for buying direct are 3 additional included licenses: a NFR internal-use license, a demo license, and a free-to-use 30 day promotional license you can use to customize your pitch.

Option 2: Buy from Pax8's marketplace. This requires adding as many seats as you want to the cart and purchasing them directly from the portal. No need to interact with sales prior, and you get access to the platform right away and with minimal upfront hassle. You will receive an email from a Pax8 rep offering some assistance to get started, but it's more in the spirit of ""here's my contact info and calendar, grab some time so we can get you onboarded."" Nice part about Pax8 is that you can buy a single seat or two.

What we discovered was you cannot purchase from both Cynomi directly and Pax8. Apparently these are two entirely different instances. They do share some sort of similar front-end authentication platform, since both instances are aware of accounts that have been setup on one platform vs. the other (and they require unique credentials), but the licenses purchased directly from Cynomi or via Pax8 marketplace cannot be merged into a single instance.

Other software platforms we've been able to move our licenses over to Pax8 or off of Pax8 with just an email to the vendor or to our Pax8 rep. This is not at all the case with Cynomi. I sure hope they work this out at some point because the minimum purchase of 6 licenses from Cynomi is a massive barrier to entry, which Pax8 has clearly presented a solution for by allowing you to buy a single license at a time. However, it's a not a great look for any software provider like Cynomi to have a second point of rigidity where a license purchased through Pax8 cannot be added to or merged with an existing Cynomi engagement."

But to be honest, it’s never felt efficient. Between the outdated interface and the confusion clients have during signing, it often feels like I spend more time supporting the tool than actually getting contracts out. On mobile, especially, it’s a nightmare.

I’ve also experimented with Dotloop and Skyslope, and occasionally just go back to downloading the DORA forms and filling them out manually when I get frustrated. I’ve even worked with a few TCs and property managers who said they’ve built full workflows around patching these tools together with other software.

I now have an offer to join a fundraising marketing agency that advises NGO.The role includes:

A senior level strategy and advisory position

Responsibilities like project management, building campaigns from a to z for clients, giving workshops, leading fundraising strategy sessions, and presenting to potential clients.

I’m very excited by the challenge I want to grow, work harder and learn a lot. 

But I'm afraid I can't handle the pressure of an agency and the work.But I would like too.

Public speaking stresses me out a lot,(I tend to freeze or block, might be csome childhood trauma there)

I do tend to have a some “impostor syndrome” and that I’ll fail or have no clue what the hell I'm even talking about.

Has anyone made a similar move to consultancy/agency? Was it worth it? Does anyone have any advice?

Any thoughts would help. Thank you so much"

Most of them provide prebuilt chatboxes and customer portals with very little option to customize. The result is a very easy and fast integration, but you are left with an experience that looks disconnected from the rest of your site.

Would companies find it valuable to build their own customer support experience? Instead of building everything from the ground up or using a prebuilt service, they can use something that lies in between - an API that provides all the primitives they need to manage customers, tickets, messages, etc. and they can control their own UI.


This way they control their own customer support experience and craft it to what works best for them. What do you think of this idea? Do you think you’d like to use something like this for your product ?

**Why am I doing this**:

Okay so I have been creating apps and websites for the past few years, made more than 25 apps and even published them on Playstore but got no real traction to the apps.

To solve this problem I have created an email list where founders who are making $250 - $10,000 MRR can list their SaaS/App for absolutely no cost and I will share their product and story with the email subscribers.

**How can founders benefit from this:**

Since you are a founder who is making in between $250-$10000 your SaaS will get the exposure to the subscribers of the email list and those who think the product is useful or are inspired by your story will check out your product and even purchase it.

**How can email subscribers benefit from this:**

As the SaaS/Apps are from small founders, the subscribers can checkout the products which they feel are useful for them and help small founders by buying it or since the founders are having a reasonable MRR email subscribers can get inspiration from the product &amp; founders story and can motivate them to try being a founder themselves.

A few things I’d love to hear about from this community:

(1) Are you currently doing anything to deliver learning or support within the tools your people use every day?

(2) Have you tried any external tools or vendor solutions to do this? What’s worked (or fallen flat)?

(3) Have you run into challenges or resistance — from employees, IT, or leadership — when trying to implement something like this?

(4) In your experience, are there situations where this kind of in-context learning really shines — or doesn’t deliver enough value?

Here’s the truth: I don’t have the cash (or even own a credit card) to keep dumping into high-ticket programs. But I do have the fire, the drive, and the willingness to show up and do the work. I’m just done paying big money upfront for potential instead of for proven results. 

So, here’s my idea — a “Pay As You Grow” coaching model. 

You (the coach) say you can help me grow my business? 

Let’s agree on a clear roadmap with goals and milestones. Each time I hit a milestone, my monthly payment to you increases. If I win, you win. If I don’t, we reassess or pivot. Simple. Aligned. Results-driven. 

And honestly? My dream outcome is that I have such massive success, I’m thrilled to pay you early, or even in a lump sum as a thank-you bonus. That’s the kind of relationship I want with a mentor — one built on shared skin in the game.

But does this even exist? Are coaches offering this? If not… why not? Is it fear of risk? Lack of trust? Too hard to track progress? Because if you really believe in your method…And if I’m really willing to do the work…Shouldn’t we both bet on that?Let’s talk. And if you’re a coach who does this or is willing to — slide into my DMs. You just might be my person."

3,Coaches: Still manually writing session notes?

Then, I discovered AI tools like Otter and Fathom. Now, my sessions are recorded and summarized automatically, complete with timestamps and highlights. I can easily customize the recap, send it to the client, and move on with my day without mental fatigue.

Some unexpected wins:

* Clients love the fast, detailed recaps
* I’m more present during calls—not distracted by typing
* I’ve reclaimed HOURS each week from admin overload

Start small if you’re a coach who hasn’t explored AI yet. Tools like these are simple to use and make a real impact.

My clients are home service business owners. I want to add value to what I do by helping them get setup and trained on a CRM.

The main things I want are to be able to manage leads, view/manage a pipeline, and have automated follow up emails setup. Tasks as well.

I really don't need much beyond that, just an affordable option with those few features.

A lot of the home service CRMs focus mainly on job estimating and invoicing, so you kind of pay more for something you don't necessarily want.

3,Agile analytics. Does it sound about right?,r/data,Tristanico,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/data/comments/1lsngan/agile_analytics_does_it_sound_about_right/,"Hello data wizs. After some years in local government, I started my own LLC. I am trying to develop an identity to help clients and get paid. I came up with this: Agile Analytics. Which is, basically, to act as a Manager of the Analytics Product of the client. No matter the stage of development of such product.

I understand the analytics product as a series of data engines. Each engine process different sources to produce KPIs and answer business questions. Say, currently I manage two data engines for my client (pro bono, family tie) to 1) calculate revenue and 2) track email conversations. Each data engine is a repository, and I track them as Git submodules. The first processes pdfs, docs, and excels, to extract sale information and save it in a database. The second pulls the Gmail API and analyses conversations.

To bring the 'Agile' part, I am iteratively refining the project scope and the implemented engines. Gathering feedback from the client at each step. And using that feedback to guide work. From week one, the dirty product makes a contribution (at first, it was simply 'I noticed we need to follow up in such and such conversation').

What do you guys think? Do you think this is a sound way to move forward or is it too general to stick?

Thank you!

\-&gt; Side note. I could talk about engines further, the way I see it a good engine:

* Constantly runs.
* Has an API.
* Architecture helps to easily add and condense operations.
* Includes engine performance checks (including processing success and hardware performance).
* Thorough software testing.
* It is minimal, with a clear structure and history.
* Logs everything.
* Fails gracefully."
3,Am I screwed (do I stand a chance for the Georgia tech masters?),r/data,Zestyclose_Ad8449,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/data/comments/1lrryis/am_i_screwed_do_i_stand_a_chance_for_the_georgia/,"Hi everyone! I don't know if this is the correct place to ask about this, but I do need help in discerning my application to an online masters. I have completed a rather rigorous bootcamp in data analytics (programming w/ python) to a successful degree (and will continue to complete the academny's nanodegree in the near future) (This academy is one of the more reputable ones in my city.

). The academy has advised me that after I complete the course, I should apply for an online masters, and it listed Georgia Tech as a good choice.

However, there is one major issue that I am dealing with and that is my grades at university. (I am being super vulnerable here, so please be a bit more gentle and tactful and not bash me for a mistake I made years back). I left uni 2 years ago, and my gpa, translated to a US score is roughly around 2.5/2.6/4.0 scale.. (It was the roughest patch of my life, and graduating in itself was a huge miracle already, plus there were some dumb admistrative errors that I made that pushed my score down).. I know myself how horrible it is (compated to Georgia's 3.0/4.0 requirement), but since then I've pushed myself out of this hole and am working hard to be in a better place........

Is it worth applying still to the course, or should I just forget about it? Some background stuff (that may boost my application) is the nanodegree I am on my way to completing (though I am uncertain if it will be recognized by the University), and more coding projects that I am about to try doing .. I might also apply for it after I land an intership/start working in D.A. too... what do you all think."

3,[OC] I turned my economics research into a space mission control center with real-time financial data streams,r/data,Important-Mirror1913,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/data/comments/1lj76zi/oc_i_turned_my_economics_research_into_a_space/,"**TL;DR:** Got tired of boring academic portfolios, so I built EconStellar - a cosmic research station that makes economic data analysis feel like piloting a spaceship.

**The Problem:** Academic research dies in PDFs. Complex econometric models that could inform real policy decisions get buried in university websites where nobody finds them.

 **The Solution:** EconStellar treats economic research like an active space mission, complete with:

  🚀 **Mission Control Center - Real-time dashboard managing all research projects**

  📊 Live Data Streams - OpenBB financial API integration showing market conditions🌌 Network Visualizations - Financial contagion spreading like cosmic phenomena

  ⚡ Transfer Entropy Models - Policy impact analysis with sci-fi aesthetics

  🎸 Parallel Universe Portal - Because sometimes guitar theory parallels economic modeling

  **The Data Visualization:**

  \- Real-time cryptocurrency contagion tracking using wavelet analysis

  \- Environmental policy network effects visualized as interconnected galactic systems

  \- Financial crisis propagation models displayed like space radar

  \- Market volatility streams flowing like cosmic particle effects

  **Cool Technical Features:**

  \- Auto-popup cosmic events that surface relevant research based on current market conditions

  \- Terminal-style logging that makes data analysis feel like mission control

  \- Network topology visualization with floating nodes and connection lines

  \- Responsive design that works on mobile (yes, you can run mission control on your phone)

  **The Tech Stack:**

  \- CSS animations with hardware acceleration for space effects

  \- R Shiny dashboards embedded as live mission data

  \- OpenBB API for real-time financial feeds

  \- Custom visualization algorithms for network analysis

  **Research Projects as ""Active Missions"":**

  \- WaveQTE: [https://avishekb9.shinyapps.io/waveqte-dashboard/](https://avishekb9.shinyapps.io/waveqte-dashboard/) \- Wavelet-based financial contagion analysis

  \- ManyIVsNets: [https://avishekb9.github.io/ManyIVsNets/index.html](https://avishekb9.github.io/ManyIVsNets/index.html) \- Environmental economics network analysis

  \- didTEnets: [https://avishekb9.github.io/didTEnets/](https://avishekb9.github.io/didTEnets/) \- Transfer entropy for policy evaluation

Why This Approach Works: Visitors now spend 10x longer exploring the research. Complex econometric models suddenly make sense when presented as ""cosmic data streams"" rather than academic jargon.

   **Live Demo:** [avishekb9.github.io/econstellar](http://avishekb9.github.io/econstellar)

  **Data Sources:**

  \- OpenBB Terminal API for real-time financial data

  \- Custom network datasets for policy analysis

  \- Cryptocurrency market feeds for contagion modeling

Sometimes the best way to make serious research accessible is to stop taking the presentation so seriously.

**For fellow researchers:** Your data deserves better than boring static charts. The universe of economic research is vast - time to explore it differently.

Would love feedback from the r/dataisbeautiful community - what other research areas could benefit from the ""space mission"" treatment?

Tools used: JavaScript, CSS3, R, Shiny, OpenBB API, lots of coffee, and Rock n Roll!

When I shared this on LinkedIn, property managers started reaching out.

One introduced me to his Minpaku (short-term rental) workflow:

\- Download city PDFs/Excels

\- Manually check zoning, school zones, license feasibility

As an engineer, I thought: *This should not be manual.*

I went deep and built:

* A **clean database + map of 13k+ licensed Minpaku properties (Tokyo, Sapporo, more coming)**
* A **unified database of the scattered municipal regulations**
* Now, I can layer those + see where Minpaku is possible, and where it’s blocked

# What’s next?

I’ve made this into [MinpakuTrends.com](https://www.minpakutrends.com/) — for now you can explore the data/map.

* A tool where you drop an address → get license feasibility instantly

Genius, right? 🤦‍♂️

My Frankenstein “productivity system”:
	•	Notion, where my big plans go to die.
	•	Apple Notes: home for “million dollar ideas” I never open again.
	•	Reminders app: for deadlines I bravely ignore.
	•	Actual paper stickies—because apparently, 2024 is just 1987 with better Wi-Fi. (These just become permanent laptop tattoos.)

The pain?
	1.	Every thought lands in the wrong coffin, and good luck ever finding it.
	2.	Weekly “review” is me scrolling endlessly through my own chaos for 20 minutes, then rage-quitting.
	3.	I rewrite the same to-do three times, hoping organization will rub off by osmosis. (Spoiler: it doesn’t.)

What I’ve tried, in a fit of optimism:
	•	Jamming everything into Notion. The UI is soothing, but my tasks still vanish like socks in a dryer.
	•	GTD “weekly review” works great… the one time a month I actually do it.
	•	Voice memos + auto-transcript: Turns out, talking to yourself just creates more digital mess.

**Why did I get a hundred phone calls from lenders after I got pre-approved?** 

Answer:

**Because the credit agencies sold your information.** 

How do credit agencies like Experian, Equifax and Transunion make money? 

Well one route is through something referred to as ""trigger leads"". When a lender pulls your credit, they are sending a request to the credit agencies for your credit report and score. 

When the credit agency receives this request, they know you are in the market for a loan. So they sell that ""lead"" to hundreds of other lenders looking to vulture your business. The credit agencies know everything about you. Your name, your SSN, your current debts, your phone number, your email, your current and past addresses etc. And they sell all this information. 

Well wait you might say. ""Don't I want to get a quote from hundreds of lenders to find the lowest possible rate?""

Sure. If that's why they were calling you. But a large portion of these callers are not going to offer you lower rates, they're simply trying to trick you into moving your loan, especially because buying all those leads costs money. Quite a few will lie and say they work for your current lender. Some overtly, some by omitting that they are a different lender. ""Hi! I'm just reaching out to collect the loan documents for your application!""

On the positive, they'll usually stop calling within a few days, but that's still a few days and a few hundred calls more than anyone wants to receive.

Currently the only way to stop your information from being sold is to go to the official website www.optoutprescreen.com and removing yourself."

They said there were no more units left in stock (as others bought up inventory for the snow storm) and offered either a refund (his unit was on sale or was an entry level model that was affordable already) or that he could purchase a massive gas snow blower that costed like 4 or 5 times what his product cost. 

To me it seems a breach of contract for them to accept payment then 7 to 8 hours later when the customer arrives say they sold his item. That's a clear contract violation but even more so I'd expect the computer system should automatically update the inventory for available units. While they offered a full refund, they did also try to up-switch him to a much more expensive and less desirable model for him as he specifically ordered a small electronic model.

Not that he wanted to pursue any action regarding this at that time, but when he told me the story it sounded pretty malevolent. This could have been the store willingly selling already sold inventory immediately with the hopes that someone from an online order is desperate enough to not take a refund and instead buy the much expensive product. 

Thoughts? I don't know how often people bring such things to small claims or any actual court, or if the main course of action is reporting to the BBB and potentially FTC and moving on with your day. "

* Chasing clients for payments

A few weeks ago I posted about a tool I was building for tracking purchase orders in small companies. At the time, I thought it was solid… until I actually tried using it like I was the end user.

That’s when I realized:  
It wasn't very good...  
I wasn’t building it with day-to-day usability in mind.

So I went back to the drawing board and redesigned the entire thing around how *I* would want it to work if I had to manage POs all day. Here’s what I ended up shipping in this new version:

✅ Dedicated Purchase Orders tab with full sorting/searching/filtering  
✅ Supplier management tab  
✅ Reporting section with charts and key metrics  
✅ PO detail views with notes + status history  
✅ Simpler and more intuitive UI

The idea is that this is not an ERP, but a lightweight tool that can sit alongside one &amp; perfect for small procurement teams or companies managing POs in spreadsheets.

You can test the live demo via the link I'll leave in the comments

Would love honest feedback on:

* Whether this solves a real pain point
* What’s still missing
* Whether you'd ever use or pay for something like this

Here’s how Receiptrix works:

* Monitors Gmail for receipts and invoices (from vendors, subscriptions, etc.)
* Also watches a Google Drive folder where they drop photos of physical receipts
* Uses OCR to extract key data (vendor, amount, date, category)
* OpenAI corrects and formats the data into clean rows
* Google Sheets logs all receipts with categories like  Software, Travel, Meals
* Sends a monthly summary report: totals by category, flagged duplicates, and missing info alerts

No more last-minute panic or guesswork Receiptrix keeps everything ready for the accountant.

If you hate tracking expenses manually, this setup might just save your brain.

* Google Sheets logs the episode link and publish date

I can get it to work initializing all the defaults do 'denied' first, using:

    &lt;script&gt;
      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
      function gtag() { dataLayer.push(arguments); }

As the GA4 tag adheres to the consent, it is managed automatically and a hit is only processed after consent is granted. 

However: only a user\_engagement event is then recorded. I think this is expected behaviour? What is the best way to then still get a page\_view event, so my analytics aren't way off and recording more active users than pageviews?

I hope this question makes sense. I'm jumping in to do some light bookkeeping for my husband's business; we have a proper accountant so I'm mostly sending estimates and invoices, coding transactions, and creating custom reports so we can see things like what equipment we're renting out the most, how much we're paying out in labor, etc. I have experience doing all of this at a previous job, but anything more than that and I'm running to Google or in this case Reddit 😆.

We have one customer, also a vendor, who likes to just cancel out or reduce invoices when we both owe each other money. This worked fine when the business wasn't using any accounting software (I mean not really, tens of thousands of dollars of earned income vanished into dust as a result, and who even knows what we have ""paid"" them without actually paying them, but it is what it is). I have no record of past money that we've owed them that they've used as a ""credit"" because every time I ask her for invoices for our records she sends me one invoice for like $140 and says that's everything, which is obviously untrue.

So now that we're about two months into using QBO, I have a partially paid invoice for them that is technically fully paid, because they deducted the cost of what we owed them from their payment to us. So a $9440 invoice still has $1987 outstanding.

My question is this: is it possible to create a bill for them as a vendor for $1987, and apply that as a credit to this invoice so that it's fully paid? If so, how?



Editing to add that I don't think a credit memo is the way to go, since from my understanding a credit memo is more like a discount than an actual payment. But please tell me if I'm wrong!"

Looking at previous posts, there seems to be a lot of love for Abnormal. In my current POC of both Abnormal and Check Point, we're so far enjoying Check Point more. Their team is more responsive and really knows their product. We're not seeing any difference in detection rates between tools. Our backend is Microsoft 365. We're a CrowdStrike shop, so going into this, I was leaning towards Abnormal due to their integration, but I'm wondering how useful that really is. Two concerns I have with Abnormal are 1. Future API rate limiting by Microsoft and 2. The fact users receive the email, and then it is removed. I've have a couple occurrences during the POC where the alert is still on my iPhone, but no longer in my mailbox. I'm concerned that would open more tickets with our support staff. I'm wondering what others have found in their recent experience with both products?"

1,Advice on choosing a brokerage - MA,r/RealEstate,PresiTraverse,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1ltxiar/advice_on_choosing_a_brokerage_ma/,"I got my salesperson license for Massachusetts a few months ago and haven't joined a brokerage yet. ERA Key realty actually had someone meet with me, which I found very kind and showed at least some willingness to invest in their salespeople. What are some brokerages I should consider and things I should look for when considering which to join, beyond whomever offers the best split? What do you wish you had known or considered? Any brokerages I should absolutely stay away from?

About me: 

I wanted to get my real estate license because I am getting more interested in working for myself and having more control over what work I take on and when. I like the idea of the relative flexibility of being a real estate agent. 

I have a mostly corporate and business-focused background and an MBA with an advanced engineering degree. I would find it interesting to apply my business background to commercial and industrial deals, but am not adverse to residential/vacation homes. Investment properties would also be interesting. I would probably try to get my NH and/or ME licenses in the future for vacation properties, for example. 

I have a decent network among higher net worth individuals (top business schools, MBB consulting and private equity friends) in MA which I hope to leverage, but am not afraid to hustle for new connections and clients either. I would like to keep my clientele in higher property value range (though that's not too hard with the high prices in MA honestly....)

I feel like I would want a place that offers some training as someone totally new to this industry, but am very comfortable with planning and self-motivating. 

  
Any advice would be highly appreciated!"

1,"Changing first name, Massachusetts",r/legal,rage-blackouts,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1ltw5ut/changing_first_name_massachusetts/,"When I was 18, in Mississippi, I legally changed my first name by petitioning the court and the petition was granted.  I still have that document. I never got the name changed on my birth certificate because I would have had to go to that state in person to do it, and it was way too far.

My new/changed first name is currently on my driver's license and passport and all financial documentation.

Now, a decade or two later and living in Massachusetts, the original reason for doing that is no longer relevant, and I'm getting tired of having to worry about extra documentation every time I go through any process involving the State or Federal government.

I'm also concerned about voting laws changing, since some states may require your ID to match the name on your birth certificate now/soon.

If I were to change my name back to the name on my original birth certificate now, would it be legally like I had never changed it?  By which I mean - when getting a new driver's license or passport, could I skip providing the name change documents?

Or would it just mean I now have to present TWO sets of name change documents (to the new name, back to the old name)?

I'm looking, potentially, for a hard reset so it's like the original name change never happened and I can stop worrying about proving my identity through court documents.

Thanks in advance!"
1,I built an AI-powered productivity tool that watches your screen,r/Efficiency,Sitemba,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Efficiency/comments/1lsyru2/i_built_an_aipowered_productivity_tool_that/,"I built an AI-powered productivity tool that:

✨ Watches any area of your screen using computer vision

🎯 Detects changes based on natural language descriptions (""notify me when the download progress bar reaches 100%"" or ""tell me when the 'Buy Now' button appears"")

🔔 Sends instant browser notifications when changes are detected

📸 Captures screenshots of the changes for context



How it works:

\- Create a tracker and describe what you want to monitor.

\- Select the screen area to watch.

\- Let the AI monitor while you do other things. You can see the status on your phone while away from your computer.

\- Get notified the moment your target change happens.



I initially built it to serve my use case so it feels kinda niche but I'm particularly interested in hearing from anyone who finds themselves staring at screens waiting for things to complete/change

An example would be a video editor waiting for a video to finish rendering or a developer waiting for code to build. I would love to get some honest feedback. What am I missing? What would make this genuinely useful for your workflow?

Most face swap tools work one image at a time. We wanted to make it faster.

So we built a batch mode: upload a source face and a set of target images.

No manual editing. No Photoshop. Just clean face replacement, at scale.

Image shows the original face we used (top left), and how it looks swapped into multiple other photos.

The double major would require five, which would bring my course load to 18–19 credit hours per semester for my final three semesters.

I'm also curious about the recent changes to the CPA requirements. Is it more beneficial to complete a master’s degree before taking the CPA exams, or would it make more sense to gain two years of work experience first and then take the exams?

Lastly, has anyone here worked in accounting while pursuing their master’s? The program I’m considering is fully online and would take 20 months to complete."

A year ago I left a senior-level job for a role which also advertised as senior. The pay was much higher and I was led to believe during the interviews that I would have considerable ownership.

The reality has been very different. I am never invited to important meetings, so I have a very narrow view of the projects. Instead, my lead assigns me granular ""tasks"" which honestly are mostly grunt work (cleaning some data, validating a table or at best, building a SQL view). I have tried the ""proactive"" approach of asking questions about the broader-scope and proposing solutions and even though his replies are sympathetic, his actions don't match his words. Sometimes I feel like he treats me like a child pretending to drive—letting me sit in his lap and steer, but never actually giving me control. Even when he ends up being proven wrong on something I warned him about (which happens quite often) he doesn't acknowledge it, just goes on as if it didn't happen.

Why they pay me what they pay me for work that a new grad could do is beyond me. I'm increasingly afraid that management will eventually wake up to this fact and let me go. What's worse: that'll force me back into the job market with a ""senior"" title and very little to show for it in terms of recent experience. I've been preemptively applying to other jobs, but as everyone on this sub knows, the market is unforgiving right now.

Any advise? Should I escalate this with my manager (who's not the same as my lead) and risk potential conflict if he doesn't handle it correctly? Should I even be drawing that kind of attention to myself given the current climate? Or should I focus on building stuff/skills in parallel so that I can I see my way through a future interview?

1,Reducing tax load while not beeing in no mams land,r/digitalnomad,blckDTshadow,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1lufrs4/reducing_tax_load_while_not_beeing_in_no_mams_land/,"Hey everyone,

I’m looking into the best countries for freelancers to legally optimize taxes and social security contributions. Here’s my situation:

    Freelance income: around €150,000/year

    Get out of my current EU home country. 

    I want to establish genuine tax residency in a country with low income tax and social security burden

    No purely “tax haven” setups or just mailing addresses — I plan to actually live there

    Keep a serious, prestigious face. Panama and Paraguay and some other destinations are out because of it. 

    Currently comparing Uruguay, Bulgaria, Estonia, and Mexico for freelancer-friendly regimes

Here’s a rough summary of my understanding:

Bulgaria

    Income Tax: 10% flat

    Social Security: ~30% (mandatory for residents/freelancers)

    Total Approximate Tax Burden: 40% (€60,000)

    Notes: Low flat tax rate, but relatively high social contributions. Social security is difficult to avoid if you're tax-resident and self-employed.

Estonia

    Income Tax: 20% flat

    Social Security: ~33%

    Total Approximate Tax Burden: 53% (€80,000)

    Notes: Digital nomad friendly, but social taxes are high. Estonian e-Residency is useful, but not a tax residency solution on its own.

Mexico

    Income Tax: ~30% progressive

    Social Security: None mandatory for freelancers

    Total Approximate Tax Burden: 30% (€45,000)

    Notes: You can freelance without paying into the national social system. Fairly easy to establish residency. Tax compliance is important.

Uruguay

    Income Tax: 0% (territorial system; foreign income is not taxed for first few years)

    Social Security: ~25%

    Total Approximate Tax Burden: 25% (€37,500)

    Notes: Very attractive due to the territorial tax system and residency options. Social contributions apply if living and working from Uruguay.


Some questions I have:

    How do you handle income tax as freelancers in these countries? Any legal ways to reduce it?

    How strict are residency and tax rules in practice?

    Are there other countries that might be better for freelancers with high income?

    What pitfalls should I be aware of when choosing a country for freelancing?

Would appreciate any experiences especially regarding willingness by eu companys to be billed from either country and any other advice!

Best,
blclDtshadow"
