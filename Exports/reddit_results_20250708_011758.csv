Because for me, even starting a productive activity feels so heavy. At the same time, I'm getting tired of seeing myself do nothing productive or beneficial.

My girlfriend had her license plate on her car taken by a cop because he said that the DMV stated she  had no insurance.  But she does have insurance and has had insurance for years now. She goes to court shows the proof, the judge tells her she has to go to the DMV and get a paper stating that she was able to provide proof to the dmv or pay $500 fine.
 This is where things  Get frustrating. So she goes to the DMV shows them that she's been insured for years now. shows them the proof which was on her phone because it's an online company. And they proceed to tell her that they do not accept it. they think that it's fake because it's on her phone and she doesn't have an actual physical card.  So she calls her  Insurance  company And ask if they would contact the DMV to get the straightened out. They said it's not  on their end and that they have.  So now she is stuck, don't know what to do or who to talk to or how to go about getting this straightened out. We can't afford to flush $500 on this scam in my opinion. "

7,Need help managing my emotions on this project/client,r/freelance,BladerKenny333,12,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1hublc2/need_help_managing_my_emotions_on_this/,"Not sure where to start but basically I have this client who is starting a new venture and wants me to design a presentation deck that is exciting. The thing is there is no visual branding. She sends me a work in progress content with several slides with barely with content. So I send her back something super basic as I don't have anything to work with, no photos, no colors, not typeface choices and she's not even done with the content. She said it's not exciting which I already know, I don't understand the point of this. Also she's in the middle of getting the branding done by someone so why am I designing anything before that? Then last night she sends me an updated content doc, it's 40 slides and she asks if I can design that in a day. I told her it'll take two days, but I'm starting to get really upset.

Before the presentation she had also sent me some screenshots of logos she likes and asked me to make a logo similar to those. And wanted to see round1 in 2 days. That had already upset me because it's a dumb way of doing logos. I did them, very quickly and she decided to take that part of the project to a branding consultant, which is fine but all these things are really a waste of time.

Any advice in how I should manage this situation? I want to make sure I'm not being controlled by my emotions in this."
7,Help!

We're on multiple channels - Meta, Google Ads, LinkedIn, programmatic, email, now they're whispering about influencers... My screen time is 90% just staring at different dashboards that all tell me slightly different, conflicting stories.

I know leads are coming in, sales are happening, but trying to genuinely trace back which specific ad, touchpoint, or channel actually made someone convert feels like trying to catch smoke with my bare hands. I spend hours seeing reports together, and when my boss asks ""So, what really drove Q3 growth?"" I feel like I'm performing interpretive dance with a spreadsheet, hoping they're mesmerized by the arm-waving. 😑😑😑

How are you all actually making sense of the full customer journey and proving which of your 7,000 marketing activities are the real movers vs. just expensive noise? Is there a way to untangle this mess without needing a PhD?"
7,Am I terrible at my job?,r/Bookkeeping,OutrageousArt7123,24,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bookkeeping/comments/1lpn7h1/am_i_terrible_at_my_job/,"Six months ago I started a role as a bookkeeper for a small company (about 30 employees). Im fairly new to bookkeeping and had no experience with payroll or certified payroll. I explained this during the interview process and that I was looking for training and to grow my skill set. I was told they were interested in a candidate who needed training and would train me. 

Fast forward six months and I’m completely overwhelmed. Turns out no one at the company really understood how certified payroll works and I haven’t received much training but I’m expected to handle all of it alone. The person who was “training” me was fired. My boss acts like i’m incompetent but I’m trying to figure it out and when I do know something he doesnt trust what I’m saying and asks for a second opinion. There are no SOPs on how things are done, I’ve just been stumbling along figuring it out. I actually made a lot of notes and SOPs only for them to somehow get deleted by our tech guy?? Things are constantly changing and once I begin a process I have to change it. Employees keep getting moved to different positions with different responsibilities and not knowing how to do their job (which causes a lot of mistakes and makes everyone’s job harder). Most employees are new (within the last year including my boss). My work load seems too heavy for one person and immediately I had to begin putting in 9 hour days (sometimes more but never less). Turns out there’s been high turnover in my position (4-5 people in the last six years). I tell my boss I’m overwhelmed or I need help. He just tells me I need to learn to work faster. 

Every day my boss is constantly telling me what I still haven’t done, to work faster, and pointing out my mistakes. When I ask what specifically he wants me to prioritize, he says everything should be a priority. I started sending him reports of what I’ve worked on and tried explaining that I don’t have enough hours in the day to complete everything. He still says to just work faster. Am I just too slow and not detail oriented enough? I can’t tell if I’m the issue here. 

I’ve tried to quit twice but it would be hard to explain only having six months on my resume for this job. I really like bookkeeping and want more experience but I’ve been crying a lot and super anxious and stressed. I really want to do better with payroll too but I’m not sure it’s for me if I keep making mistakes. It just feels so chaotic here and I’m not sure if this is normal or if I’m just really bad at my job."
7,What do you find to be resistance to businesses getting a bookkeeper,r/Bookkeeping,Longjumping-Let-4358,30,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bookkeeping/comments/1l1rqm7/what_do_you_find_to_be_resistance_to_businesses/,"A big argument i hear when talking to businesses on reasons they don't need a bookkeeper is they don't have the finances to have one or they can do it themselves. While this cn be true in the very early stages I think after a year in and especially for restaurants it becomes more important to have a dedicated bookkeeper. I have a friend who is a business owner of a bar and does his books only enough to pay sales tax (pulls data of POS unit) and other state taxes and then does made three weeks intense catch up of his books at tax time. I know he is not the only business owner who does this.

What are your arguments for why businesses need a dedicated bookkeeper and what has helped in convincing potential clients to realize they need help, or have all of your clients known they needed help and come to you?"
7,How to get status from engineering teams?,r/projectmanagement,swissarmychainsaw,24,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1kivmwk/how_to_get_status_from_engineering_teams/,"What's a good way to get engineers to give project updates?  
I need something easy and light weight. I should say *Perceived* as easy.  
They feel like giving updates is just useless overhead.

PS - We just Jira...

Thanks

Edit: Going to add some more details here.

I'm fairly new to this team and what I see is there's a lot of tribalism, what I mean by that is you can only understand what's going on if you are talking to people directly, and all the time.    
Not all of the work is captured in milestones and stories (we're getting better).
  
Right now we have a meeting once a week to discuss ""sprint updates"" but it's this free form - go around the room and ramble about what you're working on, which does not scale and it makes doing status reports a friggin nightmare.

I'm trying to move them to a written update (255chars max) in a jira field. This will save time AND prevent 5 people from interviewing you when something goes wrong: See my Jira ticket on this issue.  
Which actually just happened to a team member yesterday.  
With a written update then you have time to have a conversation, which usually yields important information like ""oh yeah, I need help with this thing..."""

7,Credit card fraud? A furniture store opened a credit card without me there,r/legal,jadytw,37,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1lh5k2o/credit_card_fraud_a_furniture_store_opened_a/,"So me and my mom went to a furniture store about 3 weeks ago and we financed some furniture under my name because we thought it would help my credit. The furniture store financed it with a company called Americas First Finance, they told me to call once the furniture was delivered to set up the payments. Well that same week we bought the furniture they started taking automated payments which I did not mind, but I still waited to call until after it was delivered. Keep in mind we only financed 1900 and I have a receipt saying it. Well the furniture was delivered Thursday and my mom did not like the couch, so she went back without me and asked to trade it for another one. The new one she wanted was 1000 more and the furniture store said to finance that amount. So she said okay, but she texted me to see what I think. I said to ask if it affects my credit and she said the worker said no. well the store financed it with a different company called synchrony and 5 minutes later I get a text and email that I have been approved for my new home credit card. I call my mother freaking out and she was apologizing because she did not know it was a credit card. They never told her, I texted her pictures and the worker kept saying it is not a credit card and that it’s only financing. Well this morning I called synchrony and they told me it is indeed a credit card. Going back to the original company we financed with, I called them this morning as well because the furniture store told me to call after it was delivered. I called and I was informed the amount that was financed was 2300 not 1900, I asked how that was possible and they told me to talk with the furniture store to resolve this problem. I’m not sure what to do now and seeking advice. Are they allowed to open a credit card like that without me there? And what do I do about the other financing since they are saying I owe more than I was originally told?

7,Non-profit status denied in Virginia and we already established a board of directors and have been operating for 6 months.,r/nonprofit,Remote-Camel6946,14,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/1lphj44/nonprofit_status_denied_in_virginia_and_we/,"We were in the process of becoming an educational nonprofit and just found out our 501(c)(3) application was rejected. For the past six months, we have been actively running events. We have hosted over nine community-centered gatherings and they have gone really well. The turnout and feedback have been amazing.

But now we are in a tough spot. We have been making money from these events to cover costs, not for profit, and we are not yet a registered nonprofit or LLC. We are operating in Virginia, but without full legal structure, and it is starting to show.

Our board has grown frustrated. They are unpaid volunteers and I understand where they are coming from. It has been a lot of work and we are still not officially established. Some are even saying we have not held enough educational events, even though we intentionally include education in everything we do. There are also whispers about trying to vote out the founding team and take over the organization. That has been deeply painful. I have put in everything to get this off the ground and I was not expecting that kind of shift so early.

**Here is where I need help:**

1. What can we do after getting our nonprofit status denied? Can we reapply or restructure to improve our application?
2. Our events have generated money mostly to cover costs. Are we at legal risk for doing this without nonprofit status?
3. We are not an LLC or nonprofit, just registered to operate in Virginia. I am worried about liability and responsibility. I do not want to be personally liable.
4. The team dynamic has changed. Some people seem to be working behind our backs trying to push the founder out of the board so they can take over, and while I know the mission should come first, I also feel really disheartened. I have given everything and I still believe in what we are building. It's only been 6 months and I a m not done finding the organziation.

I want to keep going and do things the right way. We have created something beautiful that truly serves the community. But I am overwhelmed and honestly a little scared.

Has anyone been through something like this? Any advice or support would really mean a lot right now."

-   **MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:**

-   Your daily schedule needs flexibility, letting tasks shift within a routine.
-   You want to track how long tasks actually take.

-   You have many tasks with strict, unmovable times.

**TickTick**

**Link:** &lt;https://ticktick.com/&gt;

TickTick is pretty easy to understand and has a strong task prioritization. It even has a calendar view and a built-in Pomodoro timer, which is nice. Sometimes, though, I felt overwhelmed by the number of tasks on screen. Its AI assistant (on paid plans) can help with task creation and planning.
-   **MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:**

-   You want a task manager that's quick to learn and use.

**Any.do**

**Link:** &lt;https://www.any.do/&gt;

I liked Any.do for its easy cross-platform use. But it just didn't give me that satisfying ""reward"" feeling after checking off a task, which I personally need to stay engaged.

-   You need a simple to-do list that syncs easily across iOS, Android, and web.

**Trello**

Trello felt a bit tricky to set up at first, but once I got it, it was easy and pretty fun, especially for visual organizing. My main problem was the lack of a personal reward system.
-   **MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:**

-   You have a specific workflow that works well with Kanban boards.
-   You're a visual person who loves card-based organization.
-   You collaborate with others on projects using shared boards.

**TaskCoach.AI**

**Link:** &lt;https://taskcoach.ai/&gt;

It's like having a personal productivity coach in your pocket (web-based, freemium). It digs into your performance, pushes for consistency with goal tracking and daily quests, and gives personalized guidance in a gamified setting with daily tasks, guided videos, research, and the option to chat with your coach.

**Focus To-Do**

**Link:** &lt;https://www.focustodo.cn/&gt;

I liked Focus To-Do, which combines task lists with a Pomodoro timer. But I rarely used the task features, and it sometimes glitched, resetting my Pomodoros.

-   You want to combine your to-do list with a Pomodoro timer.
-   You need to customize your Pomodoro intervals.
-   You work across many different operating systems.

Forest is cool! It makes focusing a game by letting you grow a virtual tree while you work. But I found it easy to just close the app lol, which defeats the purpose if you lack self-discipline.
-   **MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:**

-   You're motivated by gamification and visual rewards for focus.
-   The idea of ""killing"" a virtual tree encourages you to stay on task.
-   Your main distraction is your devices, and you have decent self-discipline.

-   **MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:**

-   You're okay with ""killing"" the virtual tree if distraction hits.
-   You need strong external reminders to use a system.
-   Your biggest distractions come from internal thoughts or your environment, not devices.

**Habitica**

**Link:** &lt;https://habitica.com/&gt;

-   Habitica was a fun, gamified trip through my day, but I often found myself playing the game more than actually getting tasks done. It gamifies your habits and tasks by turning them into a role-playing game.
**MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:**

-   You love video games and gamified personal management.
-   You like a clear split between habits, daily tasks, and one-off to-dos.
-   You like being part of a community.

-   **MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:**

-   The game itself distracts you from actual work.
-   Leveling up a character doesn't appeal to you.
-   You need strong prioritization features for your tasks.


**GoalMentor.app**

**Link:** &lt;https://goalmentor.app/&gt;

GoalMentor helps you turn vague ambitions into actual action plans by breaking things down into steps, asking clarifying questions, and guiding you through each part. You can chat with the AI mentor when you're stuck, track progress visually, and work inside mini workspaces for each task.

-   **MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:**

-   You struggle to start big goals and need help knowing where to begin.

-   You want clear steps and AI coaching to guide you along the way.

-   You love seeing progress over time and being held accountable.

-   **MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:**

-   You prefer completely free-form planning without AI input.

-   You're mostly focused on daily tasks and not big-picture goals.

-   You don't care about coaching, analytics, or structured help.

**Dreamfora**

**Link:** &lt;https://dreamfora.com/&gt;

Dreamfora helps you pick a goal, then uses AI to instantly create a structured plan with habits, tasks, milestones, and tips. It also comes with motivational quotes, daily reminders, and a large productivity-focused community.

-   You like the idea of AI doing the initial planning for your goals.

-   You enjoy motivational content and appreciate visual habit tracking.

-   You want to be part of a positive, supportive productivity community.

-   **MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:**

-   You prefer to plan and organize everything yourself from scratch.

-   You're not into motivational quotes or community-based platforms.

-   You're just looking for a lightweight task or habit tracker, not full goal planning.



**Taskade**

**Link:** &lt;https://www.taskade.com/&gt;

Taskade is like Notion meets AI Agents. It's a flexible workspace where you can manage projects, brainstorm, and even build your own AI assistants for tasks, research, and automation. It supports lists, boards, calendars, mind maps, and real-time collaboration.\

-   **MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:**

-   You only need a basic to-do list and nothing fancy.

-   You get overwhelmed by too many features and customization options.

-   You prefer minimalist apps with a super clean, distraction-free interface.


**Productive**

**Link:** &lt;https://productiveapp.io/&gt;

I really enjoyed Productive! It was super easy to use and made tracking habits genuinely fun. There were a few small bugs, but nothing that made it unusable.
-   **MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:**

-   You want a simple, intuitive system to track your habits.
-   You have some habits with specific times and others that are flexible.
-   You like personalizing with icons and colors.

-   **MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:**

-   You need tangible, in-app rewards for completing habits.
-   You crave extensive stats and data for deep habit analysis.

**Loop Habit Tracker**

**Link:** &lt;https://loophabits.org/&gt;

I actually really liked Loop Habit Tracker, even though I only planned to track a couple of habits. It's super effective, and I particularly enjoyed the detailed stats it gave me.
-   **MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:**

-   You prefer simple, one-click tracking for your habits.
-   You're super motivated by comprehensive stats and progress reports.
-   You like seeing all your habits at a glance on one screen.

-   **MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:**

-   You get easily overwhelmed by a dense list of habits.
-   You only want to track a very few habits with minimal detail.
-   You're looking for a super simple, visually stripped-down app.

**HabitHub**

**Link:** &lt;https://habithub.de/&gt;

HabitHub is a good app, but I quickly felt overwhelmed by seeing all my habits and trackers laid out. However, if you like seeing everything at once, it could be a great fit.
-   **MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:**

-   You're highly motivated by detailed stats and numbers.
-   You're less visual and prefer a non-graphical interface.
-   You need to see all your habits at a glance.

-   **MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:**

-   You're a visual learner and prefer pretty interfaces.
-   You get easily overwhelmed by too much info at once.
-   You need an aesthetically pleasing app to stay engaged.

After testing around with 20 different productivity apps over a few months, I ended up mostly sticking with just two in the end: TaskCoach.AI and Notion.

TaskCoach.AI is the one I use every day, it breaks big goals down into smaller steps, gives you video guidance, research and the ability to chat with an AI coach, so you don't have to waste time Googling everything yourself. It also has this slight gamified vibe with and consistency tracking, which gives a nice touch.

Notion is my go to for organizing project plans, notes, random ideas, long term stuff. It's super flexible and clean.

Sometimes I also use Reclaim.AI when I'm really busy and need help blocking off time for deep work.

So that's it! Hope I was able to help someone with this little summary!"
7,How long do you think is too long to work on a ticket?,r/it,Thynameiszed_,30,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/it/comments/1kx4zi6/how_long_do_you_think_is_too_long_to_work_on_a/,"I asked this on another sub but I figured I should also ask here. 

How long do you think is too long to be working on a ticket?

The company that I work for wants 30 tickets completed each day. I work for a company that supports the Navy and their standards are 8–10 minutes per ticket (email) 12 mins on phone, and 20mins for a chat. 

If these are not met our personal metrics go down and affects performance (of course). 

I feel this is too strict, tickets that come in can range from so many issues from setting up authentication, to escalating, to assisting with downloading different software/PKI certs the EU needs to perform their duties. I feel burnt out and like I’m juggling my job performance guidelines and assisting the customer, but I could just be still learning the ropes since I’m new to this field. 

I should add that I am a T2 agent, and times include documentation, correcting, researching, and resolution/escalation. 

There are no proper escalation paths or ticket categories as we just take them in one at a time. We use an AI assistant that our customers hate, and 80/20 will get wrong with what the customer actually needs. 

The support from our supervisors are if we have questions or need help- put it in the chat. An agent will eventually help us but there’s a 50/50 shot no one helps. 

Metrics are also tied to job security (of course), however most agents (~60%-70%) are failing not only metrics but QA’s. Documentation is very very anal here, and it really takes time to make sure that we have everything that happened in that interaction within documentation. My supervisor has told my team multiple times “If you sneeze, document it.” (Not serious but yk what I mean). 

If we fail to include anything within documentation, my QA score goes from 100% to 60% and a passing QA is 90%. QAs are random so we’re expected to get it right every time. 


TLDR: how long do you think is too long to be working a ticket? "
7,Office thinks my job is a joke,r/marketing,horahj,21,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1laoe10/office_thinks_my_job_is_a_joke/,"I need help staying above water at this job while I look for an exit. The company I work for is quite outdated, and their presence on social media is no exception. My boss, a spineless ass kisser, doesn't give me objectives, hates promoting our products and services on socials because they think its tacky, and doesn't really stand up for our team when people come to us pointing fingers.

Admittedly, I'm a rookie on socials, so our performance is up and down, but since I haven't been given much direction on what they want (only everything they don't want, which sometimes comes after filming and editing has been done), I just do whatever. It isn't random or thoughtless, but I guess I just make up objectives for us and hope it aligns with the unspoken goals my boss and our CEO wants for our socials.

Lately, I've been trying to include more of our customer-facing employees on our socials, and the posts I've made with them are our top performers (if you can even consider Likes and Comments performance). The videos are often humorous or hopping on a trend that ties back into one of our service pillars in a clever way, but I've recently gotten wind that people in my office (not the customer-facing employees in the videos) think our socials are strange and that my work is a waste of time- I heard the first part of that from my boss, who felt the need to share that feedback with me with no further directive. I've started to feel that people in the office don't think my job brings value to our brand, and I've witnessed them scoff at me while filming videos or speak condescendingly about the content I create when I'm in earshot. Someone even approached me and asked, ""So your job is to make random things for our social media page?"" When I tried to explain our content pillars and the objectives I made up, they just gave me a blank stare and nodded their head and said ""Okay, whatever you say"".

I cannot trust my boss to defend me when people approach him about this, and I have begun to feel really uncomfortable and tense in the office. I just don't feel welcome/supported and I don't know if it's because I'm doing something wrong, but even if that were the case, I don't know what I'd need to do to make it right!"

So quick explanation I’m 22M and as of right now I moved back in with my dad and started managing /co-owning his newest small restaurant(he owns another that’s doing really well that he also started, and I helped with when I was still in school) so into the problem, the second business is not doing great and I’m starting to struggle with money a little bit, but that’s not the issue the main one at least the main one is essentially I went to a two-year culinary school and since about 1415 I’ve always dreamed of working in the culinary field and having worked for him twice now and in a few other restaurants from everything to Pizza to sports bar steakhouses I’m starting to feel like I kind of hate working in the food industry because even when I had a pretty good, I would say paying steakhouse job. It felt like the only reason I stayed was for the money about a year ago. I was also going to go to college and start a new career path, but basically convinced myself out of it because I have this mentality that this is what I’ve been doing since I was 16 and it’s been my goal to be in food and I just can’t seem to get away from that. I’m going on 22. I don’t know what career path I really want to go down. All I can think about is how peaceful it was when I worked operating forklifts and other warehouse equipment and such and I really regret quitting that job and getting back into food service because I just enjoy the stability of a“ regular stable job” honestly now I know I’m only 22 so it sounds crazy but I don’t know if now is the time to try to drop everything and go back to college or try to get back into warehousing because I remember at the time when I did warehousing, I really wanted to be unlike the maintenance team type people but now I’m honestly just kind of lost in which direction I wanna go.

Honestly, the worst part is I went into this with my dad thinking I would enjoy it and he put down a substantial investment to start a second business that I was gonna handle and now it just seems like the whole thing it’s going south and I constantly am in a state of stress because I feel like it’s my fault and that I should be doing better But even besides all that I just don’t enjoy it as much as I thought I would and I’m scared to mess up the relationship with my dad because I feel like I can’t just walk away from her like any other job and there’s also the part of me that doesn’t know if I even want to walk away but I’m not sure how to talk to him about it. I’m just not sure what to do and I need advice.

TLDR I feel like I can’t get away from food service and I really just want a “regular job“ I can’t figure out how to tell my dad that I don’t really want anything to do with the business that he started in part for me to run because I know he spent a lot of money to get the business rolling, but it’s not doing so well and I don’t want to ruin our relationship money"
6,I need help.

Our leadership team (probably just like yours) is on a huge AI kick right now asking for us to find ai powered everything. Annoying but okay. I get it... We’re looking for a tool that:

1) Works with Active Directory for user syncing  
2) Tracks high-volume users or teams submitting lots of tickets  
3) Uses simple tags (like ""network"" and ""printer"") instead of rigid dropdown  
4) Offers a wizard or guided flow for users to submit tickets easily  
5) Will let us send out a basic satisfaction survey after a tech sets the ticket to pending closure

and If'dthe user clicks ""no"" on the survey, it should reopen the ticket and escalate to a manager. If they click ""yes"", it should close it out with optional feedback. If there's no response after a few reminders, it should auto-close the ticket as ""no response""... AND... I know I'm getting greedy. But it would also be nice if it has Slack integration and some AI to auto-route or categorize tickets.

What would ya'll recommend that actually works well? I'm looking at Tidio and Freshdesk right now. But want more options."
6,Chasing a Ghost,r/sysadmin,cleveradmin,5,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1lobmmr/chasing_a_ghost/,"I need help. We initially had a single client who has made us aware of an intermittent issue over the last month wherein a few of their computers become unresponsive, either during login or just during regular operation, and it requires a power cycle to get back up and running again. When we were first made aware of this issue, and they told us about it before a power cycle, the device was communicating to our RMM (Ninja) and other remote access tools like Screenconnect but attempts to remote in were futile (including running scripts, commands, remote anything). It was at this point that the office manager started asking around and discovered this was impacting several more PCs, but that the users hadn't said anything. We ran some event log analysis scripts and determined that as many as 20 out of 40 PCs were being forcibly rebooted (still waiting for confirmation from the end users as to the exact reason why). We pulled event logs and did some analysis and found nothing out of the ordinary.

As we had essentially been investigating this as a single customer issue, I started to wonder if we had other customers with similar issues that just weren't talking to us. So I expanded out the script to all \~400 endpoints and I'm now looking at over 200 computers that have been power cycled in the last month, 117 in the last week and 22 so far today. We have started reaching out to the end users and the so far the responses have been mostly similar (computer unresponsive when arriving in the morning or during login). So obviously there is a larger issue going on here, although I don't believe that all 200 computers are impacted by the same issue. End users do weird things for weird reasons. But of the devices that also had event ID 41 from before June 15, it occurred once or twice in the previous few months and could easily be attributed to things like a power outage. Things I have considered already:

1. The affected computers vary in age, manufacturer, version of Windows (10/11, different builds) and CPU.
2. We grabbed the history of event ID 41 and dumped it into a Ninja custom field and the vast majority of instances (75%) occurred after Windows updates were installed on June 15th.
3. All 400+ computers are running Ninja, Huntress, ControlD and RoboShadow agent. \*\* Edited for clarity.
4. Most of the computers are non-AD non-AzureAD (the first client is AD).

I'm honestly not sure where to look next. I saw one issue related to one of the Windows Updates this month, but it appeared to be limited to a specific build of Windows 11. Any help or direction would be appreciated, as I'm banging my head against the wall at this point."
6,I want to own student housing. But $2.5k saved.

But deep down, I’ve realized I don’t want to go into academia or the typical science career path. What I do want is to one day own student apartment complexes near universities — ideally enough that I can live off the rental income and grow from there.

The problem is… I have basically nothing right now. I make a small income (working as a receptionist) and I’ve only managed to save about $2,500. I have no idea where to start or how to break into real estate development or student housing. I don’t have rich parents or connections. I’m willing to take out loans and work hard, but I want a smart, realistic plan to get there.

Some of the things I’d love guidance on:


	•	What are the first actual steps someone in my shoes should take?

	•	Should I aim to buy land first, or find properties to flip/rent?


	•	How do I educate myself on this business?

	•	Should I work a higher-paying job first to save up capital?


	•	Has anyone here built apartments from scratch? What was your pathway?

Any advice, book recommendations, podcast recs, or mentorship stories would really help. I’m hungry to learn and get started — I just need help finding the first foothold.

She doesn't get a lunch or break time as they don't close for any period of time. Is this legal and normal in this medical field? On another important note. The Urgent Care had two separate break ins. Her and the entire staff were written up for it,  the break in. She didn't know any door codes, medical cabinets codes that held some prescriptions. She wasn't negligent as she had no clue. They want her to sign a document stating she was in the wrong. I told her not to sign it as she had no clue. Does anyone have input/advise I can help her with? She literally comes home in tears due to the UC not even having proper supplies to take care of her patients.

I'm a female who immigrated here in the US just 2 yrs ago. I dont drive in my home country but I am a fairly defensive driver. But I understand that accidents and mistakes do happen and unfortunately I'm stuck with this mistake right now to which I need help advice :((

I got into a super duper minor accident last April in an entrance of a shopping district and yes I am deemed at fault (even though the other car is speeding going INSIDE a shopping district T\_T) But I sucked it up, I got police and insurance involved cuz otherwise I do not know how to handle everything since this is literally my first time. Fast forward this day July, the other car's already repaired ofc my insurance paid for it.

But also today I received notice that the other person opened a bodily claim and got an attorney against me. T\_T They claim shoulder pain from what happened that radiated to their neck and lower back... and I'm just at awe... I work in the hospital, I dont mean to undermine what they experienced from their side but on the day the accident happened, we were both even standing outside our vehicles waiting for the police. I get that adrenaline works but from my POV it's just minor impact and idk if their shoulder even hit anything... BUT OK again, I am not that person so I do not know if what he still claiming is true, but my question is... how does it go from here?

I live in Florida and I got 10k coverage for bodily injury. My insurance tells me the person's attorney is claiming all 10k right off the bat. And is that even POSSIBLE? T\_T I also wanted to know if ok let's say for whatever reason they were able to justify their bodily pain is 10k, how do I know it's from the accident?! How do I know the person is not lying to just get money :((

Again I do not want to undermine their body pain if it's real but I do NOT think if they experienced pain, it's definitely not worth 10k :((

  
edit: i shared/posted here as i genuinely do not know how insurance here in the US works since i just immigrated 2 years ago and never experienced car accidents from my home country. had to learn the hard truth from cruel commenters here, hope these ppl would never be in my position. for those who were understanding and empathetic with their advices, I hope only you guys exist in social media, reddit needs more of you &lt;3"

6,Do I fire this client?,r/agency,theopinionator--,9,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/agency/comments/1jmbcnm/do_i_fire_this_client/,"Need some input on a situation. 

Owner of a smaller agency for 3 years now, we have been pretty successful all things considered. I have a full time job and most of the team does too. 

I’ve been working on a new client for social media management for the past 6 months. A much larger high end steakhouse. 

The manager is an older angrier man who has been kicking our negotiations on and off

Meeting one- loved me and my partner, spent over an hour talking through what we do and how our social media package specifically was great for them. 

Meeting two: met with the manager, the chef and the head of private events, same thing meeting went really well until the manager lets call him “Bob” asked to see one of our preview video production jobs. We showed him another high end restaurant, everyone in the meeting loved it but him. He went ballistic in front of everyone, how he hated the video, but everything he hated about the video was more so about the previous restaurant’s ambiance and decor and kitchen cleanliness. It was quite odd, but non the less asked me to call him again in a few weeks. 

Meeting three: he told me to prep for another meeting with the owner of the entire steakhouse which was a big deal. And spoke through some additional details 

Meeting four : meeting with the owner and Bob. We presented our social media packages. The owner loved everything about. We talked through upfront cost as well as monthly fees for the content shoots and management fee. (Only for social media). Once the owner approved and left. Bob dropped a bomb on us that he wanted us to do email and text marketing for them as well and was blown away when I told him the cost associated with our original quote did not include email or text and said “what!? Email and text is social media no?”  We corrected him and chalked it up to a miscommunication. 

I sent him contract and the engagement fee invoice, and he exploded again, he was apparently unaware of the engagement fee and demanded it be split in half. I negotiated a hefty discount in order keep the long term relationship alive. 

Meeting five (yesterday): he has still not signed the contract or paid the engagement fee, he promised after this meeting). Breaking All of our rules I set up a kickoff / discovery call to review their lengthy intake document they provided as well as get an understanding for any additional scopes of work so I can properly quote him. 

Again he added additional services like website maintenance and the addition of promotions to the site and was shocked to hear none of that was included in the basic social media quote. 

I pushed back and was aggravated. This is a wild experience and honestly I need to add an additional 3k a month for his wild expectations and daily marketing requests and ad hoc services. 

We charge  very fair price for our services. I want to mention that their current workflow they need help with isn’t essentially hard work. But his demands will be as I am his assistant 

Has anyone ever taken on a client like this and not regretted it?

How do I tell him we are not a good fit? Or do I just price him out 

Any feedback is appreciated

I have been researching business models for ages, learning them inside out, and even trying some but there's always huge problems like oversaturation, age restrictions, etc. I found out about freelance brand scaling and thought of it like every other trending business model (Oversaturated, and too difficult). So I looked over it, until I found out about something similar. I cold call local businesses, offer them advertising, and have a freelancer run and optimize the ads. The thing is that I learned there is no such thing as oversaturation, you just have to be better and stand out. I don't just sell advertising, I guarantee a business certain amount of leads, if I don't perform to it, they don't pay me. This stands out because I offer zero risk for the business. I already have a domain, a website, all my expectations and goals, I even called over 100 businesses per day and found clients. Now I am trying to finish setting everything up so I can close these clients and get moving. ONE BIG PROBLEM. I'm 15, and I can't set up a Facebook business manager account, I already told my parents, my mom is proud, my dad obviously being the smarter one, tells me the reality of business (which I understand). Taxes, fees, legality, etc. I already got my dad to help me set up stripe payments under his name, after a few thousand dollars in revenue I will have to apply for an LLC (my dad agreed). But I still haven't told him I need to set up a Facebook business manager, I am scared to ask my dad to let me run it under his name because he is very skeptical with letting his 15 year old son run a business under his name in the first place. I think if I told him I need access to his facebook account he has been using for over a decade, he would tell me to screw off and thats the end. Can someone give me advice on what to do (don't just tell me to wait till im 18, I have what it takes and have always wanted to be an entrepreneur). Is there a risk with me running it under my dads facebook? Can his account get banned? Can I make my own facebook account with my info and be allowed to run ads? What do I do.

6,What I can do to not pay $12000 buyout fee?,r/legaladvice,BrucefromChina,0,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1lt54hp/what_i_can_do_to_not_pay_12000_buyout_fee/,"Location: Chicago,Illinois

Context: Urgent Advice! Apartment Demands $12k Buyout Before Moving in+ Unseen Contract.

TL;DR: International student outside US trapped by a Chicago apartment’s predatory lease. Landlord hid a contract change, demands $12k despite me never seeing their signed agreement. Need help fighting this.


Hello，I’m an international student, never been to US before. I am facing a problem with a Chicago apartment. 


Here’s the timeline:

May 2025: Paid a $400 fee (including application fee and administration fee in advance)to secure a downtown apartment near my university.

June 9: After rounds of negotiations, I e-signed a lease via DocuSign.

June 13: Received a ""document completed"" email from DocuSign, but the link didn’t work. I never saw the countersigned contract from the apartment.


Pre-Lease Obligations:

Provided passport/visa copies.

Purchased rental insurance.

Paid a month rent of about $4,000 to an agency.The agent fee was contractually covered by the apartment management. However, they required me to prepay one month's rent upfront and—since they owed that exact amount to the agent as commission—instructed me to pay it directly to the agent. Acting on their direction, I transferred the one month's rent ($4,000) to the agent.


The Crisis: 

My U.S. visa hit unexpected problems, probably forcing me to defer my studies. I informed the apartment immediately.

The apartment demands a $12,000 buyout fee (3 months’ rent at ~$4,000/mo).

They claim the lease is binding despite me never receiving their signed copy.


Shady Contract Changes:

The initial lease end date was July 31. During negotiations, they secretly changed it to August 31 (buried in 47 pages of legal jargon).

I was rushed to sign within 48 hours as a non-native English speaker. I didn’t catch the change when it is an English version without my language on it.


My Questions:

Is the lease even valid? I never received their countersigned contract. DocuSign’s broken link means I have zero proof they signed.

The $12,000 demand: I can’t afford this. Are there legal loopholes? Can I fight this given the visa issue and their sneaky edit?

The $4,000 agency fee: Since I’m not moving in, can I recover this? The landlord claims it’s forfeited.

Sublease/replacement attempts: I’ve tried for weeks—no takers because most of them consider it as overpriced for the downtown.


Desperately Seeking:

Legal strategies to challenge the lease’s validity.

Resources for tenant rights in Chicago (especially for internationals).

Any similar experiences? Did you win?

Can I report this to a city agency or where I can find a lawyer?(I would like to pay the intial fee as long as I can afford it)


Why I’m Terrified:
$12000 is at a stake.  I’m just a student without SSN/credit history and without entering US before. The apartment ignored my visa crisis and won’t negotiate.

Edit1: I counted the document pages again. It has 47 pages in total, including some appendix document. Sorry  for the inconvenience.

Edit2: To avoid overcomplicating my original post, I stated the 'application fee' was $400. This amount actually comprised both an application fee and an admin fee, both non-refundable and paid upfront when applying for the unit. They sent me the unsigned contract afterward. I sincerely apologize if my wording misled you—I’m truly sorry.

Edit3:The agent fee was contractually covered by the apartment management. However, they required me to prepay one month's rent upfront and—since they owed that exact amount to the agent as commission—instructed me to pay it directly to the agent. Acting on their direction, I transferred the one month's rent ($4,000) to the agent.

Edit 4: Having never visited the U.S., I did not physically inspect the leased unit. During negotiations, I explicitly requested a current video of the actual unit condition, but the landlord refused, providing only promotional materials. As a first-time renter unfamiliar with U.S. practices, I mistakenly assumed this was standard procedure—though in my home country, physical inspections are mandatory before leasing."
6,"Advice Needed - If you were me, would you hire an agency? If so, what sort of agency should I consider? TIA",r/marketing,JustThinking86,8,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1ltc8e8/advice_needed_if_you_were_me_would_you_hire_an/,"**TLDR - One person marketing team feeling overwhelmed by lack of structure at a company that has never really needed a marketing department or budget. Looking for advice on agencies to help execute strategy.**

Here's a little background - About a month ago, I started as the head of marketing at a family owned company. The company is very well known in one industry, but they don't have a very strong brand. They've also never really had a marketing plan/budget or structure. I have large corporate and start-up experience, but I've never seen a company run quite like this.

This company is nearly over 100 years old and they definitely have been incredibly lucky with their longevity. However, it's clear in the past decade their brand equity has slipped to a competitor who clearly has a brand strategy and marketing budget.

One of the reasons they hired me is because of my experience, but as a one person department and the lack of structure from the top...I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. I know what should be done, but I need help.

Without giving too much away, here is some additional context:

• Nearly 70 years ago the founder revolutionized sports safety by inventing a new piece of equipment. This is the industry that they are very well known and respected, however there is one main competitor in this sport who has started to creep into their marketshare.

• Most of their customers are B2B (schools, gym clubs, etc), however they want to expand into a DTC with some of their products.

• I want to push PR, social (industry specific content, grow voice of authority on other sports industry they have products, but are not as well known, and B2B reach), and SEO.

• We need to refine our brand identity.

• We absolutely need to optimize our website experience. They are currently using Shopify.

• They use Hubspot for CRM and email.

• The company is located in Pennsylvania. 

But here's they thing...I have little to no budget right now. For the remainder of the year, I've been told I have about $150,000 (though I am certain the family will invest more, once they see what a marketing strategy can do.)

**So...if you were in this situation, what agencies would you RFP? With this budget, what are some of my options here?** 

**Thank you in advance for any advice!**"

5,"Finally, I did some real ABM using Clay and Webflow to automate 171 landing pages under 30mins.",r/automation,DeepNamasteValue,22,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1ln6277/finally_i_did_some_real_abm_using_clay_and/,"I’ve been in B2B product marketing for 10 years, and for most of that time, I couldn’t stand the term “ABM” (Account-Based Marketing). Every time someone mentioned it, I’d roll my eyes and think, “Great, more mass spam.”  as most were \[First Name\] type emails, that feel like they’re yelling into the void. No depth, no personalization, just noise.

**Then I noticed a pattern in when any outreach works on me as a marketer**

As a product marketing head, I’ve been on the receiving end of outreach. I’d only reply to emails when I was desperately trying to fix a problem or fed up with my current setup. That’s when I’d care about what someone was offering. So I thought, “How can I scale this and find more people who are screaming about their pain and reach them with something that doesn’t suck?”

So I was like let's target people who are already shouting about their pain points on social media. When someone posts a rant online say, then they’re basically waving a flag that says, “I need help!” That’s the cue. Instead of blasting them with a generic pitch, I started reaching out with:

* Personalized landing pages
* wrote emails using their social posts (thanks to AI)
* 1:1 ads on linkedin

All focused on their specific problem. And the best part: it worked. It doesn’t feel like spam; it feels like you’re genuinely solving something for them.

**I did that all using Clay + Webflow**

Clay launched an integration with Webflow, and it was like the universe handed me the answer. With this setup, I could automate personalized landing pages using signals straight from social media feeds. I spent 30 minutes tinkering with it, and the results? Pure magic. Suddenly, I had a way to scale ABM without losing that human touch. I was so psyched about it that I recorded the whole process (30-min job) and shared it in my qback youtube channel because if this can help me, it can probably help others who are sick of traditional ABM too.

p.s. I can't upload the full video as it is of 30mins and there is a limit of 30mins. so I'm sharing a snippet to show you how the flow looks like.

5,Need help with re-reconciliation in QuickBooks Online.,r/Bookkeeping,DanglyWorm,12,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bookkeeping/comments/1kx3kip/need_help_with_rereconciliation_in_quickbooks/,"Long post sorry, but I seriously will pay someone a small fee who can help me find a solution.

So I went in to one of my client’s credit cards to reconcile it and there was a balance discrepancy of roughly -$12k. Upon investigation, there were a like 70 transactions that had 5 different “Indirect edit by system” messages in the timeline.

All these transactions had apparently been reconciled (not by me, but by the quickbooks system) but the reconciled balance was blank. The QBO help video said to go in and change the “R” to blank. I knew this would likely mess up prior reconciliations so I called quickbooks and they told me this was the only thing I could do. I did it, and unfortunately it undid all reconciliations on this credit card. Luckily the client only had this card since July of 2024 so I thought I’d just go through and re-reconcile it.

The issue is that this is a Chase credit card with a “parent” card and “child” cards (employee cards). The credit card statement from Chase shows all transactions but when I try to reconcile the card in quickbooks, only the transactions for the parent account are there to be reconciled.

How can I go about reconciling both the parent and child cards in QBO if the transactions are not showing in QBO??

The QuickBooks “Expert” seriously told me to go in and just do a transfer from the child accounts to the parent account 😑 at this point, I knew she probably gave me bad info from the beginning…

Please let me know if more info is needed. Seriously, I’m not sure if it’s allowed on Reddit, but I will pay a small fee to someone who can help!"

Right now I am seeing that I onboarded my first client and as operator of the business it's hard to do the full work myself, as my other client(s) before the pivot still need help which is done by my employee.

5,Taking a break from true crime — trying to reset my mind and need help switching up my YouTube habits [Text],r/GetMotivated,osito_pachon,13,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1k6jwqp/taking_a_break_from_true_crime_trying_to_reset_my/,"Hey everyone!

For the past 8 years, I’ve been deep in the true crime rabbit hole — body cam footage, interrogation videos, court trials — all of it. I started watching it out of genuine interest in investigations and storytelling, but at some point it became the only thing I consumed. It’s the background noise to my showers, drives, work sessions… literally everything.

Lately I’ve realized it’s making me anxious and constantly on edge. I overthink everything, almost like I’m always scanning for danger — and I think it’s time for a reset.

So I’m doing a one-month experiment: no true crime content.

The tricky part? My YouTube algorithm is completely tailored to serve me nothing but that genre. So I’m trying to retrain it by feeding it new content that still feels investigative, engaging, or like a good deep dive — just without all the murder and mayhem.

I’m into stuff like:
	•	Pop culture analysis
	•	Abandoned places
	•	Theme park history
	•	Cult film breakdowns
	•	Endurance sports
	•	Gaming (especially video essays or retrospectives)

Open to other topics too — I just want to learn, get curious, and shake up my mindset.

And yes, I know I could start a new account — but I pay for Premium and I’m not about to let that go to waste.

If you’ve ever done a digital content reset or switched up your habits for mental clarity, I’d love to hear what worked for you. And if you have any favorite YouTube rabbit holes, I’m all ears.

Thanks for the push!

Now I'm building an application and blog in a niche that I'm really passionate about, and I'm looking for tools to help me with my SEO so I can get more traffic. I know the niche topic well, but I need help determining what keywords to target, what competitors are writing about, and how to effectively write about the topic. This is where tools like SurferSEO, WriterZen, Frase, Postpace, Dashword, etc. seem to be perfect. However, I'm having an awful time trying to figure out which one to go for. Features I do care about are: content optimization (like a WYSIWYG editor with recommended keywords/density, wordcount, etc) and topic/keyword/competitor research. Features I don't care about: A.I writing, recommendations/optimizations are great but I don't want something to write content for me.

SurferSEO seems like the go-to option. After watching a few videos on it the Topic Research abilities are great, you just put in a high level keyword and it finds a bunch of related topics grouped into clusters with a volume and difficulty score. This is exactly what I want, but the price is very high, at $59/mo it's doable but I'll certainly be losing money for a long time/forever on my little one person blog site.

WriterZen claims to offer similar tools and after watching a few videos it really seemed great, but I signed up for the trial and tried a keyword and it seemed really buggy. Like it claimed only 15% of the top 10 results were articles but as far as I can tell all were (it's not a buying intent keyword at all). And it claimed the top ranked result only has 1 word count, when it really has \~3000, and the rank 2 result has over 27000 words when really it has &lt;1000 and then a bunch of comments. Plus the Topic Research results were not great. However, its currently $79 lifetime deal with much higher allowance than SurferSEO.

All the other options seem to land somewhere in the middle, not as good as SurferSEO, but don't cost as much. Some have more content pieces per month, some have more features. 2-3 have lifetime deals.

Now I guess I'm just looking for advice on what route to go. Spend more money than I'll probably make on the better tool. Spend less money but probably not get nearly as good of results. Anyone have recommendations on their favorite tools?"

After that, I spent a year as Group Marketing Manager at a company with 250 staff and a turnover of around £100 million a year.

I like to keep busy, and I suspect I’m somewhere on the spectrum.

This isn’t really about me, it’s about the number of roles I’ve applied for and heard nothing back from. Some of these roles would mean taking a pay cut because they sounded really interesting,  and still nothing.

So far I have been posting twice a week to my business's instagram and Facebook page as well as about 10 Facebook groups for my local area. My post consists of a infographic as well as a bunch of hash tags, a link to sign up for my email marketing and my email for them to contact me. I also have a seprate page that is just a regular personal page since it will not allow me to send messages from my company page. What I will also do is find 3 Facebook pages per day that don't have a website and send them a short message to see if they are interested in design services. I feel I should add that I don't have my phone number in any of my posts or messages because I already get so many spam calls plus with my work schedule I don't answer my phone and I'm more likely to answer an email but so far I have just got a bunch of spam emails.

I'm thinking about doing Facebook, instagram and google paid add as well as depending on what happens with it tiktok, LinkedIn and x I just am trying to figure out what I would use for content on tiktok. I don't want to do any of the sites where you have to pay to bid like fiverr or upwork. Other than that I am open to suggestions.

4,how do you get qualified leads for a B2B mobile app maintenance service?,r/MarketingHelp,Katana_1170,1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingHelp/comments/1la0d1b/how_do_you_get_qualified_leads_for_a_b2b_mobile/,"i’m one of the co-founders of a software dev agency. we’ve been building mobile apps for 8+ years and recently spun off a focused B2B service: post-launch app maintenance. it’s for companies that already have a live app and need help keeping their app stable after launch.

this isn’t about building new apps. it’s about helping teams who already launched and don’t have the bandwidth or resources to keep things running properly.

the problem: we’re really struggling to get in front of the right people.

we tried google ads but didn’t get much traction. cold outreach has mostly been ignored. we’ve started working on content, but SEO will take time and we’re still figuring out how to aim it when we can’t clearly identify the audience. we wanted to try targeting app owners directly, but honestly haven’t found a good tool for that. 

we’ve got two marketing people on the team doing everything they can, but maybe this needs a totally different approach. we’re open to testing new positioning, offers, lead gen tactics — whatever it takes.

so, if you’ve worked on a B2B service like this before (especially something technical or post-MVP), i’d love to hear what’s worked for you. any ideas, tools, or examples are super welcome."

Simple: they *lead with value*. You instantly stand out when you share something that helps, inspires, or entertains. Here’s how you can do it too:

**🔑 1. Solve Problems**

Think about your audience. What do they need help with? Answer questions, share quick tips, or offer a solution they’ll use. *Helpful = Memorable.*

**🔑 2. Share Unique Insights**

Your personal experience is powerful. Share a win, a fail, or a lesson learned. Real stories hit harder than generic advice.

**🔑 3. Be Consistently Useful**

Don’t just drop one good post and vanish. Show up regularly. The more people see you adding value, the more they trust and follow you.

Leading with value isn’t just about posts—it’s about building trust. What’s one way you’ve added value recently? Let’s trade ideas below! 👇🔥"

I’m Coach Morgan — I work with the Chinese National Wrestling Team, and I’ve been using Excel to manage athlete training data. I’ve taken formal Courses, online courses and have been trying to build a template system for my team. Currently I do all the data entry and everything manually, but I purchased a template which has many of the features I want and need, but the template doesn't work properly, and I haven't been able to get a hold of or help from the creator.

I really want to learn how to build something like the original, but be able to do some more custom things, but I recognize it will take some time, so while I will move in that direction, I want to adapt this template for current use.  Currently it just functions a little poorly, the macros are slow, and the dropboxes dont work great.  The Sheet is kind of locked, so I don't know what I can do to make adjustments.  

Maybe I can make a duplicate and learn how to do these functions myself? 

how the workflow currently works:

1. I create template for team/athlete
2. I send to my translator
3. He sends to assistant coach
4. Assistant Coach hosts on chinese cloud which athletes can log onto (called tencent systems)
5. Athletes log in remotely and fill in training data
6. I download the spreadsheet with their data.
7. I manually extract their data into a spreadsheet
8. Create charts and analysis
9. Send analysis to federation and Other coaches for training adjustments and discussion

I DO THIS all manually, but I'd like to automate or streamline some of the process. I have the system i've build, which is very rudimentary, or I can adapt something someone has already made into something that Is more direct for my needs.



# With their template: Current Problems I’m Facing:

* The Excel template has poor interface (clickers and sliders slow).
* I’d like to **batch save multiple sheets ( or a team) into a single template** (each filled for an athlete) into a folder, ideally with custom names like: `AthleteName_TrainingDate.xlsx`

#  What I’m Trying to Learn:

* How to fix/save macros on Windows (or rewrite them)
* How to make a button/macro that batch saves each athlete’s sheet
* Where to start learning the VBA needed to do these kinds of things

# Extra Context:

* Eventually, I want to build a full multi-language system that allows athletes and coaches to log training and testing data offline or online — but right now, I’m focused on **Phase 1: Getting these basic Excel functions working**.
* Finding a way to build calculations into these sheets, without tampering the printing area or client interface part of the sheet.

I’m totally open to learning and doing the work — I just need help getting oriented. If anyone has good resources, sample code, or is willing to point me in the right direction, I’d really appreciate it.

Thank you 🙏

* mention the actual product they left, not just “hey \[name\]”—makes it feel like you actually care
* ask if anything was confusing or if they had a question, not just “complete your order”
* offer a little help, like “want me to hold this for you?” or “need help with shipping?”
* drop in a quick customer review, something real, not a fake testimonial
* always mention your return policy—removes a ton of hesitation
* if you can, add a disappearing cart link (bit of fomo, but don’t overdo it)
* automate the messages, but make sure they sound like human, there are tools to help you with this like ours for example ;)

after trying these, my recovery rates jumped from single digits to 25%–40% sometimes. people even replied back and thank me for reaching out (well my AI did but they are welcome i guess), which never happened before.... so honestly even if they dont purchase right away they will keep you in mind and have a good impression about your brand, it makes a huge difference in the long run.

How do i properly indicate the invoice was paid, as i need to track it for my records, but without causing an accounting issue, as now my bank is short the expected utility amount.  If i deleted the invoice that would fix the issue of course, but this just seems like the incorrect way to do it.

OUTPUT returned to workflow:

Dairy01: Milk

Veggies01: Broccoli

Veggies02: Carrots

&amp;#x200B;

Output would be:

Dairy01: Yogurt

Veggies01: Radish

Veggies02: Zucchini

The output values would be pre-determined by me (i.e. Dairy01, Veggies01, Veggies02 are pre-determined variable names with fixed values they'd return based on the specific input).

I would use whatever the output returns for Dairy01, Veggies01, Veggies02 in future steps in the workflow.

I have pfSense running as a VM on my ESXi host. It's set up as the main gateway, DNS, and DHCP server for my network.

For some reason, pfSense suddenly stopped working. I can't access the pfSense UI, and since it's handling all core services, the entire network, including ESXi and other servers, is down.

I'm completely stuck.

Any advice on how I can troubleshoot or recover from this?

I do have access to iDRAC and the ESXi server via console if that helps.

4,I have inherited an HPE MSL6480 tape library and need help getting started,r/sysadmin,T-A-Z,0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1lqp53r/i_have_inherited_an_hpe_msl6480_tape_library_and/,"So, we have this large tape library and want to use it for long term (archival) storage. I also have access to some accessoires and need advice on how to get it running.

I have the following hardware:

* MSL6480 (1 base, 2 expansion units). Fortunately they are already mounted in a rack.

* 6 LTO 5 drives (""LTO 5 HH FC"") are installed across the base and one expansion (i.e. the second expansion unit has no drives). We also have lots of LTO 5 tapes.

* all three units appear to have one magazine populated for up to 80 tapes each

* two Brocade 300 FC switches and a few transceivers (57-1000027-01 and 57-1000117-01)

* Some Dell R630s and R730s, I want to dedicate one of them to control the tape library and handle data ingestion.

I already have access to the management UI of the tape library and am currently waiting for a serial cable for the switches. I was given a possible password for the old switch configuration and hope that I can recover that. The library itself appears to be unconfigured.
My immediate goal is to wire up the hardware and get an initial configuration running. I hope there is some flexibilty regarding the supported backup software.

We run primarily on Ubuntu and Proxmox, Bacula has been used in the past and Proxmox Backup Server also looks promising. Assuming they support this library, of course. But no decision has been made yet.

So far I have the following questions:

1. What kind of cabling is required for the LTO drives? Based on my research, it appears to be multi mode fiber and OM3 and newer should work.

1. Is it correct that the 57-1000027-01 transceiver is for single mode and 57-1000117-01 is for multi mode fiber cabling?

1. What kind of controller card and transceivers do I need to connect a server to the switches? During my research I found the Dell LPe16002v3 (F3VJ6 or 6VK2R) which sounds promising, even if the other stuff supports only 8G. Whatever card is newest probably works best for me, because I can only order new hardware from a few shops. Do I need to use a card from a specific vendor?

1. The tape drives only have one fibre connector each, so I assume I just connect each drive to a switch as well as my server?

1. Once everything is connected, what do I need to know to configure the FC fabric? There are quite a few guides available on the switches, so I worry less about finding individual commands. But I have not used FC before, what are the general steps here?

1. I don't know yet how the switches are licensed. But even just the 8 base ports should be enough. Do I have a reason to use the second switch?

1. Is there any licensing I have to worry about on the tape library?

1. Is there anything else I should worry about or are there pitfalls I might not be aware of?

Guides like [this one](https://www.penguinpunk.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/fc_switches_v0.2.pdf) appear to be helpful for an initial setup, I will try to follow it once I can use the serial connection. Links to other guides are also appreciated.

Thanks to all of you, I appreciate all the help I can get on this!"

4,"First wreck, total loss, need help navigating this.",r/Insurance,palomalovett,4,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1ls24d4/first_wreck_total_loss_need_help_navigating_this/,"Hey y’all! So I recently got into my first wreck, got rear ended and pushed into the car in front of me. I filed a claim with the at faults party’s insurance (Liberty Mutual) and after the estimate came back $21,042, they deemed it a total loss. The CCC one report gives me an adjusted vehicle value of $28,227 and a total of $30,128 with state tax and title. I still owe $27,000 on my loan. I haven’t made a claim with my insurance (Fred Loya) as I didn’t want to pay my $2000 deductible, but I do have a collision coverage with a $25,000 limit. Liberty Mutual is also giving me the Salvage price of $10,178. 


So my questions are:

I noticed on the [ccc one report](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jW7tSb2dAa3yjtR5_EP2MbuCccth32bY?usp=drive_link) the comps are of different trims, both higher and lower, is this hurting my overall estimate? Should I push for comps that are of only my specific trim? 

The report also states my car is normal condition, but am getting a $2,043 deduction on all of the comps, is that just the price I have to pay for my car not being dealer ready? 

This car is still drivable and no mention of frame damage, but I did take it to the repair shop Liberty mutual recommended to me, did that nurf me as the estimate seems a bit high? Also, say I were to open a claim with my insurance and take it to a different shop, could I ask for them just to make it inspection ready and not add the cosmetic stuff? (I know it probably sounds like an ignorant question, sorry) I do realize it can still be deemed a total loss. 

Last question: What would you do in my shoes? Take the money, pay the loan and just get a new car? Fight for repairs or at least a better ACV? Take the salvage, pay the repairs little by little over time? I don’t mind paying my loan and I really liked my car. But is there really any way around a total loss? I guess I just want to fight for it since I’ve already been paying on it for two years and I was so excited to be able to own my car once I’m done paying.

I really need help figuring this out. I live in Ohio, and I had a car accident last week. The other driver ran a red light, but their insurance company is refusing to fully cover the damage to my car because I don’t have evidence or witnesses.

The other driver called the police at the time, but they didn’t come since no one was injured. They told us to file a police report online instead.
I still haven’t been able to file the report because I need her driver’s license info, and we only exchanged insurance details. I texted her asking for it, and she left me on read.

The accident happened at an intersection that has a camera nearby, but I contacted the Ohio Department of Transportation, and they told me the camera doesn’t belong to them.

My insurance company is terrible, and even if they fight for me, I’ll probably still end up paying some out of pocket. I really need to get video evidence that the other driver ran the red light, so I can get full coverage.

I don’t know which department owns or operates the camera, or how to request footage.
Should I call the police? The camera looks just like the one in this post:

Burner because I don’t want my contract cut off or any insider trading since they are public😆.

TLDR; I’m early 20’s, family business- High Value niche but very popular clothing, but dad is occupied with grandma’s illness - cannot go to a care home either, Biggest customer 700k/year (our revenue is 1-1.5M/year), they are paying very late, not looking good. I need help with sales, I don’t know what to do, as we need to cover the loss we might incur in the future before it happens

I’m in early twenties, it’s a family business, I’m 1 year in and my father has been running this for 30, grandad same product different company and was the largest fsctory in the country, I have a lot to live up to, I’ve owned successful businesses since 16+ yrs old so I know how to run a small business, but this is on another scale for me, my largest business did like 200k/in a completely different industry so i’m out of my league a bit. My dad’s occupied with my grandma who has dementia for the past 5 years still on the phone to factory from morning at 5am to be on time for when the factory opens up, I need to support my father in this so I’d love some help as he’s suffering mentally too. I’m in a different country by myself managing the factory ~ 50 employees.

We are a clothing manufacturer, we supply to a very big company, they are big for us as we do 1-1.5m/year ish at 30%ish margins I’d say net around 300-450 - I do not lnow the finances, this is a guess/estimate, I only look at the production side

Now these guys we have been working with for 15 years, always good, constant orders compared to other customers, if a product hits they order continuously,  good brand placements, the parent company is suffering (we work with 4 of their child companies) - our payment terms went from 30 days, to 60 days, and now they are paying 2 months late on 60 days, and I’ve heard they are paying up to 5 months late from my cousins who also work with them. 

Now I need to get sales up, and I don’t know how to, and I also don’t know how to deal with this customer. We work in a very niche part of clothing, but it’s expensive, and people love it, I can dive into B2C, i have the ability to make very very interesting pieces of clothing to say the least that people would pay top $$ for. I’ve been handed a business on a silver platter I do admit but I am kind of stuck on what to do. I have a very very good product, I would say our factory is one of the only in the country to be doing what we do (very high quality and high fashion).

edit - i already know what’s wrong, my dad’s business was 5x bigger, he had to scale down because of my grandma, this big customer is very easy to deal with in every other way except this. "

I am really lost at understanding which tests to use when looking at my data sample for a university practice report. I know roughly how to perform tests in R but knowing what ones to use in this instance really confuses me.

They have given use 2 sets of before and after for a test something like this:
Test values are given on a scale of 1-7

Test 1
ID 1-30 | Before | After |

Test 2
ID 31-60 | Before | After |

(not going to input all the values)

My thinking is that I should run 2 different paired tests as the factors are dependent but then I am lost at comparing Test 1 and 2 to each other.

Should I perhaps calculate the differences between before and after for each ID and then run nonpaired t-test to compare Test 1 to Test 2? My end goal is to see which test has the higher result (closer to 7).

Because there are only 2 groups my understanding is that I shouldnt use ANOVA?

If you think I'm whining over nothing that's perfectly fine, regardless of people's opinions I just want to get some recommendations. 



In my home country I often experience that colleges and universities are really hammering down on the 'school experience', that it's going to be the most important time of your life, and that for the time that you are studying there, it \*is\* your life. Now of course my studies are going to be a part of my life, but I've got a lot more going on than just that and I have no interest in a school trying to push themselves into every single aspect of my life, especially my private life. I don't really appreciate having a mandatory conversation with my mentor every month, why can't I reach out when I need help and leave it at that? It feels nosy and unnecessary. And whilst on the topic of unnecessary: months before my study even started, I was added to a group chat with 'useful info' (debatable) and fun facts about the study, the school and languages in general. Why am I forced to be in a group chat and getting sent texts from my school half a year before my study even starts?



Another thing. I'm not opposed to ocassional group projects, but over here in the country it's 90% group projects and 10% solo work, depending on the subject. My brother studied History at university and he did not have many group projects, but for languages, business, journalism and politics it's all nearly entirely group projects, especially in the first year. Now I get that speaking with others is valuable for learning languages, as is debating during politics, but it's nearly every damn project we ever do. I don't want to constantly depend on my classmates for the results of my work, I value independence a ton and also just want to be proud of work that was created solely by me. Again, a few group projects every once in a while, necessary and completely fine. Every period? Nope.



So, the question. Are there any countries where this clingy school culture is less prevalent, where schools are just for going to class and studying, and then when you go home you can actually disconnect from your education? And education systems where group projects are more scarce? Or ideally both? Thanks!"

I’m posting this as a last resort because I’m tired of these stupid technical issues. I’d also like to say that my sister owns this laptop and I do have her permission to post about this online.

So I’m going to explain how it started. When I tried to log in, as usual, it asks for my passcode. I then get the message “This sign-in option is disabled due to failed sign-in attempts or repeated disabling. Use a different sign-in option or leave your device powered on for at least 2 hours and then try again.” 

I tried this multiple times, did not work. At the time I couldn’t use the different sign-in option because the only one was signing in through my sister’s email, which she somehow forgot the password of.. anyways. After fixing her email issue I went back and tried to reset the laptop. As you can see from the first image, it worked (it’s a Dutch lingual laptop but it’s the same system either way). I have gone through every button, from trying to delete updates to automatic startup repair to command prompts. Now obviously a few options have fallen off because I either didn’t have it or the system just rejects my cmds. 

I fixed the email issue to try and get through this BitLocker-repair but because of security reasons I can’t get through sites like ms.aka/myrecoverykey since her phone number had to be changed and I gotta wait one month for Microsoft to resolve that issue which I don’t have the time for, even though I actually can get into her email.


And my mom has tried some things too and now whenever I try to go back to the normal windows lock-screen it just shows the BitLocker screen again as you can see in the second image. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m okay at solving device and technical issues but I just cannot get through with this. Anyone know how I can either get back to the regular windows lock-screen or somehow reboot the system through any of these buttons. 
Or maybe if you know command prompts for this device that actually work.

Thank you! Sorry for the long post I’ve been at this since yesterday."

4,Is my helpdesk job a good one?,r/it,thisismydickprofile,4,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/it/comments/1liz91q/is_my_helpdesk_job_a_good_one/,"Hi this is the first time I’ve posted here. I recently graduated with college with a cybersecurity degree, but I understood how saturated the field was so I aimed for helpdesk position right off the bat. Especially knowing it was a position where I could learn so much.

So I got a position with an MSP. I’ve been happy here for the past month or so but I don’t know if there a better positions elsewhere in the future.

As a tier 1 helpdesk they are actually launching a new training program for me and the other new hire. It’s a 2 year program and each 6 months you touch a different field. Those fields are Helpdesk, SOC analyst, project technician, and service coordinator. It sounds exciting but I don’t know truly how well it will be executed due to being guinea pigs. And it’s not like I’ll be a full on SOC analyst during those 6 months, if they need help with tier 1 I’ll be going back to that. 

But I enjoy the culture, 45k a year, and they pay for certs. But I do not exactly know the on call situation yet since I’m still relatively new. I also don’t love how every minute of my day needs to be billable hours, or at least aim to be. I love helping people and figuring issues out. And I love how it seems like the sky is the limit when it comes to learning with all kinds of unique tickets on the board.

For me, it’s so easy to get attached to job titles, but I would like to go the networking / storage engineer route in the long future. I guess what I am trying to ask is guidance in a helpdesk role. Do I stick to the unique program? Do I need to realize I’ll probably be getting better offers after just 1 year in IT? I see people make big jumps after one year, and I’m afraid if I stay in a tier 1 role too long it could look bad.

Thanks for the help. I really appreciate it."

Equipment: They have a barebones server, firewall, switch, 1 access point, a few phones, and a couple of laptops which I’m providing to replace outdated computers. The client also has 2 monitors per workstation. I’m providing the laptops at no cost (they were free from a previous client).

Services: My role will include mounting the equipment, running network drops (the building is still being remodeled), and ensuring the network is functioning properly once everything is in place. I anticipate most of the work will be plug-and-play.

Time Estimate: I estimate this will take around 30 hours to complete.

One thing I’m still unsure about is the fair hourly rate to charge for this kind of work. I’ve been in the IT field for about 5 years but don't often do side jobs. I’d appreciate any feedback.

I have already collected a lot of data, but I am struggling with how to generate, present, and compare pages.",r/juststart,Los_Joshos,9,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/17hvgq7/i_need_help_starting_a_project_that_requires_many/,"Hi

I'm currently running a blog that gets a decent amount of traffic in my niche. I would like to expand this and provide an extensive overview of certain products/services with the ability to compare them. This is of interest to my readers but is not currently available on the web.

At the moment, I have a clear idea on how it should look like and I gathered a lot of data over the last months (will take some more time to complete).

Right now, I have a spreadsheet that contains information on different products. As an example, lets say its cars and I have a list that contains the model number and some other information about a number of them (such as model, manufacturer, year, homepage, contact information, link to manufacturers logo (also have the files), description, price...). 

Now I want to generate a distinct page for each car (row in my spreadsheet, around 500 at the moment) with all the information fit in the right places (maybe something like https://www.cars.com/research/toyota-corolla/). However, I also want to make individual adjustements to these pages as required. Ultimately, I want them to be searched by specific key words and to compare them (both manually but also suggesting fitting alternatives). Maybe something such as this: https://www.capterra.com/p/171840/HubSpot-Marketing/#alternatives

I generated my blog using Wordpress.com as I dont have too much experience on webhosting, backend/frontend etc. Therefore, I already tried some options there such as the multiple page generator (MPG) plugin which worked somewhat okay in terms of converting my spreadsheet to multiple posts. I also tried to combine this with product comparison plugins but I haven´t found one that works with both my spreadsheet and doesnt generate problems with the MPG plugin (which does not generate ""physical"" posts). Ultimately, after now almost 3 weeks of trying, I am still not satisfied with the results (cannot edit single pages, comparison not possible, searching cumbersome) and I am running out of ideals. Specifically, I´m starting to question whether this project is feasible this way (with my basic experience and the help of some wordpress plugins...). 

My questions are:
Can such a project be realized with Wordpress and its plugins or should I consider switching or getting experienced help? 
Also, does it make sense to add this to an existing blog or would it make more sense to build it as a separate website?

I am aiming at 1000+ pages of products/services that I want to be generated using my spreadsheet but they also should be searchable and comparable. I am gathering information from vendors, which I am using to update my spreadsheed. Ideally I dont want to manually update each post when something changes as I´m doing it right now on my blog.

I am happy for any help or basic approach on how I could realize this project. Preferably, I want to do it on my own as I like to work on a project until it is how I want it to be (but I think I´m not able to dive into HTML, CSS or SQL). However, I also have some budget to put into it if a more professional approach (other than my really basic blogging skills) is required.

Please be honest. Writing blog posts with links and images is easy. Maybe this idea is beyond my capabilities or I have not found the right approach and the best plugins?  I appreciate any input."

I'm reaching out for some guidance regarding my recent string of application rejections for the Amazon Associates program. The reason for the rejections is the following:

""We noticed that you are not using tracking IDs associated with your store in any of the Amazon Special Links you have created on your website. As a result of this, we were unable to determine the source of traffic. ""

However, I strongly believe this is incorrect, as I have diligently incorporated the special links and even verified them using Amazon's link checker tool.

Whenever I try to contact customer service or appeal the decision, I'm met with the same automated response instructing me to reapply and ensure the use of appropriate Amazon links. It seems like they are not properly examining my ""product recommendation engines"" where these special links are located. For example, here is one of the pages where the links are implemented:  [https://simplybuy.io/product-picker/monitor/10?results=a1d3b3c2-62d7-46a3-bb32-39397e4daee7](https://simplybuy.io/product-picker/monitor/10?results=a1d3b3c2-62d7-46a3-bb32-39397e4daee7).

I'm at a loss as to what steps I should take next in order to get a human review of my website and give more clarity on the reason for my rejection. Has anyone encountered a similar issue or can offer some advice on how to proceed?  


Thank you in advance for any insights or suggestions you can provide. I really appreciate your help!"

Edit: I am a man and my ex is trans FTM

Hello, I recently got out of a very toxic relationship. We met when he was 16 and I was 18. During this relationship I was manipulated into buying him alcohol, as he used it to cope and I liked being able to provide for him as this was my first relationship. He also coerced me into being in a poly relationship, something I was hesitant and not comfortable with. He had much more sexual experience than I did, so I trusted him when it came to this. 

I told my friends my side of the story when we split up (I am now 22 and we were together 3 years) and they are saying what I did was illegal and rape.

The particular encounter comes from the first 6 months, during which I was 19, he asked me to buy him alcohol for the intention of getting drunk and having sex. He had a lot more than me, and he threw up but we continued having sex, and I only stopped when he stopped responding. I then walked him to the bus and got him home as we were outside as this was before I was introduced to his parents so we would do things in public. I have felt guilty about this encounter since it happened.

My ex (now 19) has now slept with my friend, creating a big rift within our friend group. I wanted my friends to cut this friend off, and tried to explain my side of the relationship and how toxic it was- but they are now saying that it is rape what I did after I told them this and have cut me out their lives. 

I am very scared as they said that it was rape, however I have talked to some SA victims (one of which was in the polycule) and they have all said it was not my fault. Could what I have done really be considered rape? Can I get in trouble for this?"

this all started about 2 years ago. i was on valorant and got a cryptic message from an account which was my alt account that said cryptic and scary shit. it had to do with things that i had posted on my discord account. from there i wiped out my whole friends list on discord of people i didnt know. i went and removed every person i didnt know from my following on every account i had on any platform. i was harassed for a while.

they have been calling my phone nonstop from textfree numbers and spoofing my friends/familys numbers to call my phone, calling people from my phone number, using prank phone call sites to call me and leave text to speech of creepy things.

they call me with these text to speech numbers and tell me things that i am doing. if im listening to a song, they will call me and tell me the name of the song. if im saving something on pinterest, they will criticize what i am saving.

they will also text me from textfree numbers doing the same

i have filed a report with police. nothing. i have contacted the ftc and fcc. nothing.

they say cryptic and creepy shit. im scared for my safety and the safety of my family, friends, my boyfriend, his friend, etc...

i need help! they have been also ordering food to my home. i have had to call places and cancel food. 

im at my wits end. this is the lowest point in my life and its been two years. two. 

i dont know what to do. i dont. can anyone here PLEASE help me? i dont have money to hire anyone to help. i live with my grandmother and her son, she is not tech saavy and my uncle is doing the most he can given the circumstances.

i have changed all of my passwords and accounts numerous times and they ALWAYS get back in. always. ive given up on changing things since they always get back in.

im convinced they are IN my fucking phone. they have all my contacts, and know about things ive only said on phone calls and in text messages.

they know where i live. they know about everything i do online. i dont think this is anyone i know in person but who knows. im scared. please help me!!!

4,Need expert help: Google Ads &amp; Meta Ads campaigns getting impressions but zero conversions. What am I missing?,r/marketing,WesternAcademic6923,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1lqrzj9/need_expert_help_google_ads_meta_ads_campaigns/,"Hi everyone,

I’m running into a frustrating problem with both my Google Ads and Meta Ads campaigns. Despite setting them up following various recommendations, the campaigns are getting impressions but absolutely no conversions — no form fills, no leads.

**Context:**

To give context, I am advertising my international procurement services which is already a niche thing. I gotta find clients who need to import a certain type of goods from overseas, so gotta target C-suite level people and then people with high intent to get goods from outside the country in general. When it's a bare bones request I do sourcing, inspection, logistics including clearing customs, and the rest until goods arrive to the buyer in their country, basically end to end supply chain solution. More demanding requests can have me do a few additional things like setting up something from the ground up like starting a factory, designing it for efficiency to pump out X amount of product per day or have a design be made by an OEM(original equipment manufacturer). Point is, this is definitely not B2C, and it's just a small % of people in B2B who can decide who are my target audience. Everyone relies on inbound in this industry because it's the opposite of an impulse buy. They're either expanding operations or starting a new line of operations. Sometimes just improving on existing ones. 

Now that what I do is out of the way, I setup a search campaign on google ads(no search partners no smart campaign) on a few countries (USA, UK, UAE, Germany), key words are tight(64 keywords), exact and phrase only no broad match. 

Headlines are straight to the point: Find Reliable Suppliers - Asia + Africa Sourcing - Your Global Sourcing Partner - Vetted Factories Only. I did 10 headlines like this, 

Descriptions are also straightforward like: We help you find trusted suppliers across Asia &amp; Africa fully vetted and verified. I put 4.

I did sitelinks and callouts.

No image.

out my logo.  
CPC is at 2 usd  
I put 20 usd daily budget

Today I changed to maximize clicks in hopes of getting more action.

But yeah thanks for reading all the way to here and I'll not forget your help, if it works I wont just say thank you.

**TL;DR:** 

I ran google ads fo 4 days and didnt get any impressions let alone clicks or ""conversions"" and desperately need help but dont know where to ask because service is kind of niche(international procurement/end to end supply chain services).

I’m starting to feel stuck, might be fundamental flaws in my strategy or setup that I’m missing.

I’m happy to share screenshots or specific details if that helps. Would appreciate any expert guidance that can point me in the right direction to start generating real leads. 

Thanks everyone"

I’m 16 and have been building AI tools and hardware projects on my own learning everything online and using whatever I could get my hands on.

My laptop finally gave up a few days ago. It was already old and barely holding on. Now it doesn’t turn on at all, and I honestly can’t afford a new one. My parents are also not in a position to help financially.

Before it broke, here’s what I had been working on:

🤖 An AI cold outreach agent  helps businesses send automated but smart emails/messages.

📲 A Telegram bot for Veo V3 video generation lets people generate AI videos at low cost.

⌚ A personal AI assistant I was building into a wearable where you could say “I have a meeting at 5PM on July 5” and it would auto-add it to your Google Calendar. I had more features planned.

🦯 A project I started for AI smart glasses for the blind  it would connect with ChatGPT to guide the user in real time, like “there’s a pole ahead” or “move slightly left.” This is now on hold because of my situation.

I don’t have fancy hardware or a team   just a lot of curiosity and drive.

If anyone here is willing to help me get a laptop (even second-hand), I’d be beyond grateful. I’m not begging, just hoping someone who sees potential in me might want to support my learning journey.

Even a little help or just sharing this post would mean a lot. DMs are open if you want to see proof of my work or ask anything.

Thank you so much for reading 🙏

3,Need Help: CloudKitchens Contract Dispute – Charged $52K After Closing in Under a Month,r/smallbusiness,Adept-Current2707,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1lue0w2/need_help_cloudkitchens_contract_dispute_charged/,"
Hi everyone,
I’m looking for legal or practical advice on a business situation I got into last year.

In 2024, I signed a contract with CloudKitchens, paid a $7,000 deposit, and launched a ghost kitchen in one of their facilities. Unfortunately, I operated for less than a month and received zero orders through their system. I noticed on day one that another kitchen was closing, and by the end of my first week, I heard rumors that three more had left. The area seemed dead, and traffic was almost non-existent.

I spoke with the manager at the time, and he told me that summer was “low season,” but that business picks up in December and January. However, I couldn’t afford to wait, and since no orders were coming in, I closed the kitchen early. I didn’t even complete a full month.

A few weeks later, the same manager sent me a message saying CloudKitchens had decided not to charge me for the full year, but instead would settle for $10,000 split in three payments, and that my $7,000 deposit would not be refunded. I never agreed to this, but I also didn’t have money to fight it at the time — I was near bankruptcy.

Then, months later, I received a letter from a debt collection company claiming I now owe $52,000, threatening legal action if I don’t pay. From what I understand, they’re now trying to charge me for the remainder of the full 12-month contract, even though I was only there for a few weeks and had no sales at all.

I’m really confused. How did the $10,000 become $52,000? Why is a debt collector involved when I was told otherwise? I also don’t understand how they can keep my $7,000 deposit when I barely used the space and got no results.

Right now I’m trying to find a lawyer who offers free consultations to help me understand where I stand legally and if I can fight back or negotiate. I’ve kept all the messages from the manager.

Has anyone gone through something similar with CloudKitchens or dealt with this kind of situation? Any advice, especially legal pointers or how to find help in New Jersey, would mean a lot.

Thanks in advance.

Recently, we’ve been running into major issues where shipments are being returned back to us for no clear reason.

Here’s what we include with every shipment:

* Commercial invoice with HS codes and country of origin (Canada)
* Packing slip
* Our products are made in Canada using US-imported materials, so they should qualify under USMCA and be duty-free.

Despite this, we’ve had several problems:

Shipments are returned with the reason “no commercial invoice” — even though the invoice was attached to the box.

Some customers in the US are hit with massive customs charges (e.g., 25% tariffs + UPS brokerage fees) even though the products should be exempt under USMCA.

To keep our customers happy, we’ve had to either pay these unexpected duties out of pocket or have the shipment returned at our expense.

We’ve contacted UPS multiple times, but our account manager has been unhelpful and we’re not getting straight answers. It’s costing us time and money, and we’ve got a backlog of returned shipments now.

Has anyone dealt with something like this before?

How can we make sure UPS properly recognizes our shipments as USMCA-compliant?

Is there a better way to document or flag them to avoid these issues?"

Our main product — and the one that brings the most value to the company is a fiscalization and business management software.

Our marketing team originally consisted of three people: me, another beginner like myself, and a senior marketer. Unfortunately, our senior left recently due to other commitments (he started his own e-commerce business and also manages social media for several clients). Now, it’s just the two of us handling all marketing efforts.

Recently, our manager came up with the idea to target gas stations with our software, since some of them also own chain stores and represent big business opportunities. He asked us to come up with a plan for how we’re going to sell our solution to these gas stations.

To be honest, I feel a bit overwhelmed — we're being asked to do a lot given our experience level. But at the same time, I really want to rise to the challenge.

I have experience in social media management, Facebook and Instagram ads, WordPress web development, basic design in Photoshop, and wireframing with Figma. But this project requires something different — more like traditional marketing and strategic planning.

Right now, I have a solid starting point: I’ve identified the target market, and I know how to reach them. In Albania, we have a good website , where I can find all gas stations along with their contact information, so I can start building a lead list.

I'm also planning to run Facebook ads, since I don’t think Google Ads are very effective in Albania.  
So, the two main channels I’m considering are Facebook advertising and direct phone calls. I’m also thinking about designing some brochures and delivering them directly to the gas stations. To be honest, I can’t think of any other effective ways to reach them at the moment. As for the offer, that’s something I’ll need to discuss further with the manager of course. What I really need help with is the **mindset and the blueprint** — how would an expert approach this situation? What would a complete strategy look like? And how long might it reasonably take to execute?

The good news is, I’m not alone. Our company has a variety of resources — designers, actors for ad production, a solid development team, etc. But they all need guidance, and I’m supposed to be the one who brings the pieces together and forms a cohesive strategy.

Any tips, guidance, or constructive feedback would be greatly appreciated!"

3,The new 4-step formula to effortlessly craft show-stopping headlines that get people to stop scrolling (backed by buyer-psychology),r/MarketingHelp,Popular_Lab_1302,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingHelp/comments/1bb5kph/the_new_4step_formula_to_effortlessly_craft/,"Let me guess. 

You know how to produce great content with immense value,

Or you’re selling a life-changing solution,

But you just can’t get people into your pipeline?

Here’s a quick &amp; easy way to skyrocket the # of eyeballs your catch. 

Whether it’s a salespage, video title/caption, or any form of content/copy,

where you have one shot at capturing attention for that specific content,

With just one single sentence (your headline),

Here’s the new formula to apply:

✨NESB✨

”Oooo what bird breed is that?”

It’s not lol. It stands for new, easy, safe, and big. 

NESB is proven to be the most powerful way to create headlines that people just cannot ignore.

Why?

Because it appeals directly to our most basic instincts as humans (buyer psychology).

Here’s how:

NEW-

This means you position yourself/your offer/your content/solution as if it’s something new,

You’re the only person who has that solution,

ORRR you’re the only person who can offer the solution in that ~specific~ way. 

People don’t wanna go ”Ah, heard that one before, next!” 

Be the first one. Or make it sound like you are the first one at least. 

EASY-

This one’s pretty obvious…

As human beings, we tend to be attracted by quick-fixes, get-rich-quick schemes, and overnight success,

Which basically means we’re into EASY solutions to our problems, no matter what the problem is. 

Nobody wants to put in extra effort into solving a specific problem if some Joe Shmo offers an ”easier” fix, right?

This also explains why social media is flooded with captions that go something along the lines of:

”The only thing you need to ____”

”The 3-step formula to____”

”Do THIS to ____”

Etc…

Make it sound as easy and effortless as possible :)

Next is SAFE-

On a subconscious level,

One of the decisions a person makes before they decide to spend their time consuming or buying something is,

”Does this actually work?”

And that makes perfect sense. 

Because whether it’s someone’s time or money,

Nobody wants to spend either of those two on something that might not even deliver results or be ”worth their while” in the end. 

So always include an element of safety/guarantee in there. 

And if you’re wondering how,

Well.. that’s another discussion! ;)

And lastly,

BIGGGGG.

Make it sound big, dude. 

People are flooded with information and content and solutions and idk what else,

All. Day. Long. 

If you don’t make your headlines sound significant enough,

No matter how great or life-changing your solution is in itself,

Who’s gonna give you the time of day?

No one.

There’s an art in creating headlines that make a casual scroller go ”Oh. Wait what?!”

And that’s what you should aim for. 

Make it pop. 

So there you have it, folks. 

The 4 most important aspects of a killer headline. 

Remember:

Your headlines will make or break your copy. 

If your headline is crap,

It’ll bury the rest of your copy/content under the ground with zero effort. 

Doesn’t matter if there’s a goldmine in there. 

Make it NESB!🔥

P.S. I’m a copywriter. If you need help with applying this formula (or anything sales-writing related for that matter),

Feel free to message me :)

My journey with marketing has been a long bumpy road with a lot of unexpected turns. But from what I’ve learned now unexpected seems to be a normal day for me lol. 

Although I am only 25 I have almost ten years of marketing experience. From creating campaigns targeting specific audiences, small budgets, big budgets, even bigger budgets, and no budgets I have been able to do most of it all. 

But, my problem is I have yet to do anything that will get me a meeting with an executive board. I am aware things come with time and that might sound a bit optimistic. What I mean is….I have not passed over that threshold of good - &gt; great. 

I would define myself as an idea guy with average implementation skills. I find it hard sometimes to take that in the shower “ah ha” moment and turn it in to an actionable campaign. 

My biggest struggle is pairing my ideas with reputable research that can prove my idea will be a success. I believe until now a lot of my campaigns were assumptions based off anecdotal evidence from my own life, lives of friends, or audience personas.


So the question is what is the best way to go from point A to point B while minimizing risk?

We have a website and started our first Meta ad(IG/FB) that leads to the website as the landing page.

We have GA, Meta pixel installed on the website(no events created yet. only page-view) and I see some information on the Ads manager.

**We need to track**

1. The activities(clicking which buttons(most importantly sign up and start button) on the website) of website visitors who visited the website by clicking the link on the ad. Now I only see the number of landing page clicks of the ads (on the ads manager).

**The problem is**

1. I do not know where to start... From my research, I need to do something with GA and Meta pixel events? I am so lost after long hours of research so decided to seek some help.
2. On Facebook events manager to create more events than just page view of the pixel, it says that **there is no pixel detected. Meta pixel helper detects it though**... I clicked 'Add events' -&gt; 'Add on the pixel'.
3. On GA, I do not see there is an event named 'sign up'. Also I don't see the activities of first visitors and how many of them are through the ad.
4. On ads manager, I don't know how to add URL parameters and what parameteres I have to add.

For your reference, our marketing funnel is 1. visit the website 2. sign up 3. click a start button

Any advice? Or just any recommendation of ways of learning like youtube channels? And also if my question is not clear or doesn't provide enough information for you to come up with an answer, please let me know, I will write more information about our situation.

I’ve just started the **Intermediate Excel course** on Coursera, and I’ve hit a roadblock I can’t get past. It’s related to the **Consolidate by Category** tool, and I really need some help understanding how to do it **without adding any extra columns**, as the instructions say.

Here’s what the task says:

&gt;

I’ve tried to use the **Consolidate tool**, but I keep getting “No data found” or the wrong results. I understand I need to select 2 columns — one for the category like **Priority** or **Satisfaction Rating**, and another for values like **Days Open**, but I still can’t get it to work.

Also, I’m confused because we’re not supposed to use formulas like `COUNTIF`, but still need to summarize values like ticket counts per priority.

# ❗ What I Need Help With:

* What exactly do I **select** in each week’s sheet to make Consolidate work?
* How do I properly select data when my categories (like Priority) are repeated across rows?
* How does Excel know how to ""group by category"" without me summarizing it first?
* How do I do this WITHOUT using formulas like COUNTIF or creating a helper column?

If anyone’s done this assignment or understands how Consolidate by Category actually works in this case, **please explain it like I’m five** 🙏

hello guys im learning excel and just started with excel intermediate im actually stuck with a problem regarding consolidate data , it would be very helpfull if someone spare there time for clearing my confusion.

actually the question from Coursera that :

""The next few instructions are a bit tricky. You should not need to add any columns to achieve these tasks. These tasks are similar to what was in the **Consolidate by Category (Reference)** video. In that video, we consolidated sheets that had different categories and in a different order by selecting **Use labels in: Left column**. **Consolidate by Category** can also condense multiple rows with the same category down to a single row per category.

When you select the references, note that you will need to select at least 2 columns. The first column will be used for the labels and the other column(s) will be consolidated using the **Function** that you select in the **Consolidate** dialog.

**STEP 7**: Use the **Consolidate** tool to generate a summary of the number of tickets raised per priority for May Week 4, June Week 1 and June Week 2 (combined). Sort the consolidated data by **Priority**.

**STEP 8**: Use the **Consolidate** tool to generate a summary of the average number of days a ticket was open per priority for May Week 4, June Week 1 and June Week 2. Sort the consolidated data by **Priority** and change number of decimal places to 2 (change the format, do not use a rounding function).

**IMPORTANT: Before the next step, make sure you delete the other references in the Consolidate tool!**

**STEP 9**: Use the **Consolidate** tool to generate a summary of the number of tickets given each satisfaction rating for May Week 4, June Week 1 and June Week 2. Use a **COUNT** function. Sort the consolidated data by **Satisfaction Rating**. ""

I work the overnight shift in a nursing home. I've just switched employers and the facility I'm at now is super behind the times.

One of my tasks each night is to print a legal sized landscape Word document that gets used by the nurses to write down what happened every shift.  I've converted this to an Excel document so I can have some other things automated. One thing I've done so far is have it create an ongoing census of who is in the building and who is not (they get sent to the hospital a lot and we need to know for billing purposes). I've just used check boxes with hidden TRUE/FALSE and =COUNTIF(B1:B1000,TRUE).  Attached is a screenshot (no personal info of course).

I need help with creating each shift's shower schedule reports. Each resident gets two scheduled showers a week.  The showers always happen on either the am shift or pm shift.  The schedule does not change.  For example:  Room 101 gets a scheduled shower on Tuesday's 6-2 AM shift and Friday's 2-10 PM shift.  Room 102 gets a shower on Monday PM and Thursday AM.

How can I get the workbook to print out each shift's shower schedule to include Room #, Name, and shift based on who is and who is not in the building?  The data needs to be linked to room number and not name because sadly, the names change quite often. But the room number and shower schedule always stay the same.

None of this info can be viewable on the workbook itself, but it can be hidden in it somewhere.  Also, is Excel smart enough to know what day of the week it currently is and just run the report based on that?  Like if I open it at 10:50PM on Monday night, can it just run Tuesday's without me telling it to?  

Thank you so much for helping me help old people stay clean!

Can anyone offer insight on who we could hire or use to get this done? Someone who could strategize and develop creative in multiple formats, at a reasonable price. Given our previous experience with agencies, we're not keen to go that route.

Any help appreciated!"

3,Seeking Guidance: Structuring My First Longitudinal Study Workflow,r/analytics,Maleficent_Pay_4670,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/1l260z2/seeking_guidance_structuring_my_first/,"I’m an intern working on my very first longitudinal study, and I’m not quite sure how to get started or how to structure the analysis. My objective is to observe how individuals evolve across multiple thematic areas (e.g., work hours/retirement, health, caregiving, financial status, etc.) to see how their perspectives change over time. I have two survey waves from the same group of participants (three years apart), and I need help outlining the proper workflow.

What steps should I follow to compare continuous measures over time? For example, should I:

* Run a Shapiro–Wilk test on that difference to check normality?
* Depending on the Shapiro–Wilk p-value, perform a paired t-test if it’s normal or a Wilcoxon signed-rank test if it’s not?

And for categorical variables, should I be creating side-by-side bar charts of percentages (one bar per category per wave) to visually inspect shifts?

I really need guidance on how to structure these steps—and any tips on potential pitfalls—would be greatly appreciated!"

3,How to properly categorize split subcontractor payment (GST paid separately),r/Bookkeeping,software__writer,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bookkeeping/comments/1kpeuog/how_to_properly_categorize_split_subcontractor/,"I’m using QuickBooks Online for my Canadian corporation and need help categorizing two related payments to a subcontractor.

Here’s what happened:

* The subcontractor sent me an invoice for **$84.75** (which includes **$75** for services + **$9.75** GST).
* I originally paid them **$75**, forgetting to include the GST.
* A few days later, I paid them **$10** separately to cover the tax portion (intentionally rounded up).

Now I have two transactions in my bank feed:

* $75
* $10

How should I categorize these properly in QBO so that:

1. The full $75 counts as an expense,
2. The $9.75 GST is recorded as a tax,
3. The remaining $0.25 isn’t throwing things off?

Would you recommend entering a bill and applying both payments to it? Or splitting one of the transactions manually? I’m not sure how to handle this cleanly so the GST is reported correctly and everything reconciles.

Appreciate any help. Thanks in advance!

3,Strange behavior: Our domain abc.com loaded content from xyz.com/login (different org) — need help understanding how this happened,r/sysadmin,Sorry-Term-9071,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1loy5rr/strange_behavior_our_domain_abccom_loaded_content/,"Hi folks, I’m hoping someone here might have insights into a weird issue we observed recently.

**Background:**

* We own and manage [`abc.com`](http://abc.com), which is hosted in AWS ECS.
* Traffic is routed via an AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer).
* DNS is managed through Cloudflare.
* Everything has been working fine until recently.

**What happened:**

* One morning, a developer tried to access [`https://abc.com`](https://abc.com), but instead of our site loading, they saw the login page of another site, `xyz.com/login`.
* [`xyz.com`](http://xyz.com) is a completely separate organization — we have no affiliation with them.
* There was no SSL/TLS certificate warning or mismatch — the browser showed it as a secure connection to `abc.com`.

**What we checked:**

* The DNS A record for [`xyz.com`](http://xyz.com) points to a specific AWS EC2 IP that hasn’t changed in 8+ years.
* Our DNS records for [`abc.com`](http://abc.com) in Cloudflare have **never** contained that IP — we confirmed this via audit logs.
* There’s no mention of [`xyz.com`](http://xyz.com) or its IP in our Cloudflare audit logs at all.
* Our ALB target groups and ECS services are also clean — everything seems to be configured as expected.

**Why we’re confused:**

* We don’t understand how accessing [`abc.com`](http://abc.com) could render content from [`xyz.com`](http://xyz.com) **without**:
   * A TLS certificate error (certs are domain-specific),
   * Any change in DNS,
   * Host header rewrites,
   * Or shared infrastructure as far as we know.

This only happened briefly until devops guy removed all A record from cloudfare and hasn’t been reproducible since.

**Questions:**

1. What could possibly cause one domain to show another domain’s content like this without certificate mismatches or DNS record changes?
2. Could this be a caching issue, misrouting in AWS (ALB?), or a reverse proxy misbehavior?
3. Is there any scenario where a misconfigured ALB or Cloudflare rule could cause this kind of traffic rerouting?
4. Any tips on logs or tools to further investigate this kind of anomaly?

Really appreciate any pointers. This is a bit unsettling from a security and integrity standpoint."
3,MSP Lab Environment for Mentorship – Suggestions Welcome,r/msp,Tarirai_Nkomo,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1lpdsu5/msp_lab_environment_for_mentorship_suggestions/,"I'm currently working for an MSP, and recently, my cousin and a few of his friends (a group of 5) reached out to me for some help. They've been struggling to find work in IT, and they asked if I could mentor them or provide some real-world exposure, particularly in an MSP context, to help them build a basic understanding of how things work in the field.

We’ve agreed that I’ll be assisting them remotely ,they are currently busy with MS-900 and AZ-900. So I will start with them after they certify those two. While I initially planned to just send over training videos and resources, I realized it might be more valuable to create a hands-on lab environment with real-world scenarios.

 

 **The Plan So Far(Still in my mind)**

* I’ll set up a small lab environment that they can access from home.
* I plan to host a few internal tools (e.g., a wiki, ticketing system, etc.).
* I already have to:
   * An old Cisco ASA firewall
   * An HP server
   * Various networking equipment :1800s,1900 lol
* I also have a local AD setup already synced with Microsoft 365 (using a personal domain), complete with:
   * Group Policies (GPOs)
   * Conditional Access
   * Security baselines

 

**Hands-On Activities:**

 

I'm thinking of starting fresh and having them go through steps like:

* Installing and configuring a new Windows Server
* Setting up a new domain environment
* Syncing with Microsoft 365 (they can afford basic/premium accounts)
* Exploring Intune, teams, management on their personal devices
* Accessing the local lab network via VPN after firewall setup

This project aligns with some personal goals I had for the year, and I’m genuinely excited about it even if it involves a bit of work.

 

**What I Need Help With:**

 I'm looking for suggestions for **open-source** or **free-for-small-teams tools** (supporting at least 5 users) that replicate what’s typically used in the MSP space. Ideally, they’d get exposure to the kinds of tools they’d see in production environments.

Here are some categories I’m looking to fill:

**Credential &amp; Documentation Management**

**Professional Services Automation (PSA)**

**Remote Monitoring &amp; Management (RMM)**

**Email Security / SEG / Spam Protection-**Already have SPAM Experts

**Productivity &amp; Collaboration**\-M365 (They afford Business Prem)

**Endpoint Security &amp; Antivirus**

**Backup &amp; Disaster Recovery**

**Reporting &amp; Analytics** (M365)

**Automation &amp; Scripting** (Maybe Ansible)

**Network Monitoring &amp; Management**(PRTG)

I'm also thinking this a a great certification path:

AZ-900 &amp; MS-900

SC-900

SC-900

AZ-800

SC-300

MD-102"

Hi all,

I recently faced a medical issue—**Balanitis Phimosis**—which was diagnosed by my doctor as a disease condition. After consultation, my doctor advised me to undergo **stapler circumcision surgery** as treatment.

I have a health insurance policy from **Star Health**, purchased through **PolicyBazaar**. Before proceeding with the surgery, I confirmed with both Star Health and PolicyBazaar whether this would be covered. I was informed that **circumcision is excluded unless done due to a medical condition or disease**. Since mine was due to a medically diagnosed condition (Balanitis Phimosis), I believed the procedure would be covered.

However, my claim has now been **rejected** by Star Health, stating that **circumcision is not covered** under my plan, without considering the fact that it was done due to a genuine disease.

I feel this is unfair and misleading. If the policy clearly states that circumcision for a medical reason is covered, why was my claim denied?

Has anyone else faced a similar issue? What are my options here? Any help or guidance would be appreciated.

The basic idea: a lot of us (myself included) tend to get mentally jammed,  you’ve got a thought, decision, or idea bouncing around but no clean way to unpack it. You might open a notes app, scribble on paper, or just keep replaying it in your head.

I’ve been working on a tool that helps people “refactor” rough thoughts into something clearer, whether that’s a summary, a pros and cons list, a decision matrix, or just a more structured version of what you meant.

The user drops in a messy thought like:

“I don’t know whether to go for job A or B; A is remote but boring, B is in office but exciting.”

And the tool helps break that down using things like structure, clarity tools, and even logic like SWOT or argument trees (depending on what you’re trying to do).

 fast UI and logic that reacts to the kind of thinking you need help with.

Right now I’m finishing up the frontend and wiring it to a mock backend for testing. I’m not looking for signups or validation for the idea as a product, but more like:

Have you ever needed something like this?

What do you currently do when your thoughts are messy or you’re unsure?

What would actually help you get clarity in those moments?

Would really appreciate hearing from anyone who’s been there. Even a sentence about your current “mental untangling” process would help me shape this better.

Thanks for reading."

I’m getting close to launching my first app. It’s a simple spending tracker I’ve built using **Lovable** for the UI and **Supabase** for the backend. I’m not a developer, but with the help of ChatGPT and YouTube, I’ve been able to get it to about **95% done.** (I have ideas for future features and everything, but I want to launch the basic free app). The layout is pretty close to my vision and I’m proud of how far it’s come.

Now I’m at the stage where I need help from a real developer to:

* Tidy up and polish the **UI** (padding, sizing, layout consistency)
* Make sure the **code is clean and functional**
* Set up **user authentication** (log in / sign up via Supabase)
* Prepare the app for the **testing phase** (Ideas on how to test would also be appreciated)

This is a **personal passion project**, so I’m working with a tight budget. I'm not looking for free work at all, just realistic advice. I can spend a couple hundred here and there, but I can’t go into the *thousands* right now.

So my main questions:

* What kind of dev should I be looking for? (iOS? React Native? Supabase experience?)
* Roughly how much should I expect to spend to get this app across the finish line?
* Any tips on where to find devs open to this kind of scope/budget?

3,Built a Utility to Check MSME Registration &amp; GST Filing Status in Bulk for Indian Companies– Need suggestion/ help Finding Clients,r/StartupsHelpStartups,ThisProfessional1,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StartupsHelpStartups/comments/1k2uian/built_a_utility_to_check_msme_registration_gst/,"Hey folks,

I’ve built a utility aimed at solving a very specific pain point for companies dealing with a large number of vendors.

**What it does:**

1. **GST Filing Status Tool:** Input bulk GSTINs / PANs to check if vendors have filed their **GSTRs**. This helps identify where **ITC (Input Tax Credit)** could be at risk due to the vendor not filing their GST returns.
   * Also gives a **6-month filing history** so you can assess how consistent a vendor has been in their GST compliance.
   * You can then prioritize follow-ups with vendors who aren’t regular in filing.
2. **MSME Check Tool:** Input bulk GSTINs / PANs to check if vendors are **MSME-registered**. Super helpful for filing **MSME Form-1** by April 30th and for future half-yearly filings.

This tool is especially helpful for companies with **thousands of suppliers**, where checking each one manually is just not practical.

**Now here’s where I need help:**

I’m trying to figure out the **best way to reach out to companies** who would benefit from this. Mostly large enterprises, finance teams, or even CA firms handling large client portfolios.

Has anyone here marketed a similar B2B utility?  
Would love any suggestions on platforms, channels, or communities where I could share this to get traction.

3,$1+ million in real estate but I’ve learned more from my 5 waitlisters!,r/StartupsHelpStartups,Investince,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StartupsHelpStartups/comments/1f205ot/1_million_in_real_estate_but_ive_learned_more/,"Hi guys 👋

Moe here from [Investince](http://investince.com/)

Now, you might think my title is crazy, but it's true! While I've been fortunate enough to scale my property portfolio to over a million in holdings (with only 30k of my money), I got A LOT of help along the way. There's a whole profession dedicated to helping people with real estate, so they did a lot of hand-holding.  
Starting a company is a whole different beast. There's nobody who will put in the work for you. Nobody can tell you exactly what to do. Nobody can be in your shoes, with your brain.

In the spirit of this, I just wanted to share what I’ve learned through organically gaining 5 waitlisters for [Investince.com](http://investince.com/) thus far.

1. You should be the **master key to 1000** ***red*** **doors**.

My company is a real estate search engine that brings your dream home to you through flexible, natural language-powered filters, but it didn't start that way (and might not end that way). We started as a REIT, then we pivoted to a turn-key BRRRR company, but both died slow, painful deaths. Each time I thought I was doing something different, the more time I spent on it, the more I realized it was fundamentally the same as thousands of others, wasting months of my time. I was falling into a **tarpit idea**. The point is, knowing your market and market fit isn't enough. Ask yourself how **YOU** are the right person in the **right market** to solve the problems that haven't been solved. When you pivot (which you probably will), if you're the right person for the job, you can still make it work. You should be the master lock to that market and if you aren't quite there yet, get there first.

2. Do things that **aren't** scalable.

It sounds crazy, but I learned this from YouTube, speaking to founders, and browsing Reddit. They all told me the same thing. Most of us are bootstrapping our ideas and don't have a marketing budget. We all think a single viral post can change our lives, but it'll probably never happen. Put in the work. People are powerful! Give others value and answer their questions when they need help. I've turned into a customer that way, and I've had people join my waitlist the same way. That one person turned into 2, then 3. Big things start small.

**Tip:** Facebook groups are awesome for this as they can get hyper-specific to your niche. If there isn't a subreddit for it, I guarantee there's a Facebook group that exists.

3. Not all help is good help, **BUT** **you won't make it on your own.**

I thought I could do it all on *my* own. I didn't really understand what I was signing up for. It's that famous quote: ""You don't know what you don't know."" I'm the type to ask a million questions, but **was I asking the right people?** Asking someone who's building a revolutionary toaster how their entrepreneurship journey is going might actually lead you in the wrong direction. While nobody can give you step-by-step directions on what you're about to do (otherwise they should be the ones doing it), advice from people a lot closer to your business is much more valuable. Take advice from others with a grain of salt. Think of entrepreneurship like a bespoke suit; one size does NOT fit all.

**Final Remarks**

I have A LOT more to learn. My website sucks, my design sucks, but the point is I'm learning (you should've seen it last month!) If you're interested in the things we're doing at Investince or you want to learn more, I'd love for you to turn that number from 5 waitlisters to 6! Outside of my company, DM me, and we can chat journeys. Although our businesses might not be the same, our struggles could be!"

I've been getting comments lately about how long its taking me to do things. It's almost feeling like they think I'm slacking off or just straight up not working, regardless of how many hours or weekends I work.

I'm genuinely working my butt off and stepping up for extra work whenever our teams need help. Each department kind of goes rogue with naming things, so finding a file is not a simple search. Excel is a nightmare to use because filters are almost useless. I keep asking if I can fix the issue but I'm told ""no you need to be on billable work"".

Regarding the billable time, I produce 3-10x the billable time a week versus my coworkers (seriously, last week the one got 3 hours of billable hours). 

  
It's wearing me down...I'm beginning to dread work when I usually LOVE data. I dread it so much I get a sick feeling in my stomach on Sunday nights.

I wanted to share something I’ve been working on. I recently set up a small roasted makhana (fox nut) processing unit here in Bihar. This region is known for producing the best quality organic makhana, and since we’re based locally, we’re sourcing it directly from farmers.

The idea is simple — there's already a growing demand for roasted makhana in India (especially as a healthy snack), and I’ve seen solid interest from outside India too — places like the UAE, US, UK, and even Southeast Asia. So we’ve decided to focus on B2B — either bulk sales in India or export.

Right now, I’m trying to connect with:

* Food distributors/wholesalers
* Exporters or brands looking for private label products
* Anyone in the health food space looking to source roasted makhana in bulk

We’ve already set up the machinery and packaging — we just need the right buyers now. I’m honestly new to the B2B/export world, so I’d love any guidance:

* Are there any **specific portals or websites** where I can list this?
* Any **communities or events** where people in this space hang out?
* Or if you know someone who might be looking for something like this — I’d be grateful for the intro 🙏

3,Need help improving as a soccer coach.,r/Coaching,CoachIEG,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coaching/comments/16tss2g/need_help_improving_as_a_soccer_coach/," 

Hello Community, So I was appointed as the soccer head coach for the Salem County community college in August. We have 12 players and we ended up get 2 more by changing status to club. this is the first time I am coach above the age of 15 boys.

We did not have any pre-season games, and I have failed to give the 5 that used to attend the pre-season sessions any fitness conditioning.

We have lost the first 4 matches, and they were scores minimum was 3-0, and even though we do not compete we play.

I currently had done some sessions and I believe the reason why we are bad is due to my poor sessions and bad coaching. honestly at this point I feel that I have failed the team, last night was our 4th loss against a team that should not be beating us, and I spent the night contemplating how I have failed these young talented men.

Which makes me sure that the session I have been doing are what failed these guys and in turn I have failed these players. The assistant coach and some players when I ask them say no that is not the case, but I am sure they only say this to not hurt my feelings.

my sessions:

Attacks in Wide Areas

Sections

· Part 1: Passing circuit.

· Part 2: 8v8 possession game.

· Optional (Part 3: 10v1)

· Part 3: 9v9 in an octagon.

Key coaching points

· Advancing from possession in the centre of the pitch to attacking wide areas.

· Creating overloads on the wings and breaking the defensive line.

· Making coordinated runs into space and finds the right position in the penalty area.

· Understanding passing and crossing options (e.g. cutbacks) and recognizing open space.

· Finding a well-positioned team-mate in the box to finish the cross.

· This training session was designed with a specific game situation in mind: how can the team in possession make use of space out wide to be successful against teams defending in a mid or low block?

PART 1: PASSING CIRCUIT

This passing circuit allows players to repeat the relevant actions multiple times. It

is intended to develop individual passing and receiving techniques, along with

players' understanding of when and how to position themselves to receive the

ball. To translate this into a match situation, it should help a team improve them

ability to use combination play on the wing to overcome the defense and

progress into the final third. Basic sequence: Passing circuit in a hexagon

Organization

• Create a hexagon with a width of 40m and length of 50m.

• Distribute 3 players to the positions at the top and bottom of the pitch and 2 players to the positions on the side.

Explanation

• A starts the passing pattern with a pass to B (winger).

• B plays a short lay-off to A.

• A plays a driven pass to C.

• C plays a one-two with B and finishes the pattern with a pass to D.

• D, E and F repeat the same pattern on the opposite side.

📷Variation

• Instead of a one-two between C and B, B passes to D after receiving the ball from

• C, and D plays a one-two with C.

• Add a second ball (position D).

📷Coaching points

• As a group, it is important to synchronize behaviour and progress dynamically

• without losing speed.

• Passes should be played with precision and correct timing.

• Movements to receive should be timed well. The wingers (B and E) should time

• their movement to receive or stay in a closed position to lay off.

• The central-midfield positions (A, C, D and F) require a good first touch, overall

• ball control and passing technique in order to keep the pattern dynamic.

PART 2: 8V8 POSSESSION GAME

This small-sided possession game challenges players' ability to exploit space laterally as a team. The shape of the pitch forces players to play diagonally from wide positions. Due to the maximum of three and later two touches, players need to adapt with faster decisions and creative positioning on the wing. Main focus is on playing the ball out to the wing from a central position and progressing higher up the pitch. This will get the opponent to move around and create opportunities

for the offensive line. This exercise also improves players' spatial awareness, decision-making, combination play and passing quality.

Organization

• Mark out a 50x40m octagon.

• Create 2 teams with 8 players each.

• Distribute enough balls on the side of the pitch to continue play quickly.

• The coach starts the game with a pass from outside the pitch.

Explanation

• 8v8 inside the octagon.

• Players are limited to 3 touches.

• 10 passes without the opposition intercepting equals 1 point.

Variation 1: players are limited to 2 touches.

📷

Variation 2: players can now use the area outside the octagon for a short period of time to offer additional passing options. 10 passes in a row with a pass outside the octagon equals 2 points.

📷Coaching points

• Players on the team in possession without the ball should move into different

• spaces and offer passing options, with the aim of always being available.

• Players in possession of the ball should scan the pitch and pass with the correct

• weight and quality.

• As a team, communicate, position yourselves well and move efficiently in the

• given spaces to support team-mates.

Optional PART 3: 10V1 – ATTACKING THROUGH WING PLAY

This drill improves a team's tactical behaviour as a whole. The coach shows the

players possible patterns to attack wide areas and to create chances. The players

learn to synchronize their behaviour and to understand where to move at what

time. The tactical situations focus on ball circulation, creating overload situations

on the wings, and crosses and cutbacks from the byline.

Organization

• Using only the opposing half of the pitch, 10 players line up against 10 cones / mannequins set up in a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 formation and 1 goalkeeper.

Explanation

• The players circulate the ball and stay around their positions.

• A maximum of 2 touches per player is allowed.

• On the coach's signal, a central midfielder plays the ball into the space ahead of one of the wingers/ full backs. Through different patterns of play they advance on the wing and eventually end up in the box, trying to score a goal.

Variations

Basic sequence: Possession game in an octagon

📷

Variation 1: players decide when to attack the wide areas and when to finish the attack.

📷

Variation 2: overlapping full backs. A winger initiates the transition from possession to attack by coming inside and calling to receive the ball. On this signal, the full-back on this side overlaps the winger and runs into an attacking position down the wing. The winger then plays the ball to the full-back, who then delivers the ball into the box.

📷

Variation 3: A winger can now choose to either play directly to the overlapping full-back or involve a central midfielder, who then plays to the ball out wide to the full-back. The full-back then crosses into the box as before. This helps the players realize there are multiple ways in which to transition into attack.

Coaching points

• In this drill, players should acknowledge that there are a variety of ways to transition from possession play to an attack down the wing .

• Different players can initiate the transition as well as make the run into the attacking areas of the flank.

• Communicating as a team is essential when transitioning from possession to attacking down the wing. With either movement, talking, or both, players can express their intent to initiate an attack.

• Picking the right moment to transition from possession play to attacking play on the wing is crucial. Players need to gage the flow of the game and then commit to attacking on the wing at the right time.

• To have an effective presence in the penalty area, every player making a run into the box must attack its different areas. Ideally, the near post, far post, central area, and the edge of the box should all be occupied by an attacking player.

• Players in the box need to attack different areas: Near post, far post, central area, 18-yard box

PART 3: 9V9 IN AN OCTAGON: CREATING CHANCES THROUGH WING PLAY

This is a 9v9 game that challenges the players' ability to make decisions on crossing and finishing within a game environment. It combines all aspects of the previous three exercises and uses them in real-match situations. The most important aspect is the movement of individual players and as a team to progress against deep defensive blocks through wing play.

Variation 1: Players decide when to attack the wide areas and when to finish the attack

Variation 2: Overlapping full-backs – the winger comes inside and turns with the ball, the full-back overlaps

Variation 3: The winger cuts inside again, but now passes back to one of the central midfielders, who plays it out wide to one of the full-backs.

📷Organization

• Use the same octagonal pitch as in exercise 2.

• 14-minute halves (2-minute break).

• 2 teams with 9 players each (including goalkeepers).

Explanation

• Players engage in a regular 9v9 game on an octagon-shaped pitch.

• The attacking team can use the cut-off corners and area outside the pitch to attack and to cross.

• The defending team cannot enter spaces outside the octagon, making it easier for the attacking team to progress through the wide areas.

• A goal involving the wide areas counts as two points; all other goals only count as one point.

Variation

• The defending team can now enter spaces outside the octagon, creating a situation that is closer to a real game and increasing the difficulty of attacking successfully.

Coaching points

• The attacking team should move the ball as fast as possible, increasing the space out wide and making it difficult for the opposition to organize themselves.

• Players need to ensure their first touch after switching play facilitates the flow of play instead of slowing the attack down.

• Moving the ball as fast as possible also entails finishing as fast as possible. A vast number of professional goals are scored with first-time finishes – this can be food for thought when finishing the chances created through wing play.

• To increase the chances of finishing a delivery from a wide area, the attacking team needs to have a big presence in the box. This also boosts the likelihood of pouncing on a rebound.

• Defenders must try to anticipate the winger's delivery and be aware of runs by the attackers around them.

• Midfielders on the defending team must track back in an attempt to pick up the runners that are bursting into the penalty area.

• Adapt the previous coaching points to this more realistic game situation

Quick Transition

Session overview

· Part 1: 6(4)v2: quick Transition Rondo

· Part 2: quick transition 2v2

· Part 3: quick transition 2v1 / 2v1/2v2

Key coaching points - This session requires 8 outfield players and at least 1 goalkeeper.

· During the transition, players should always be aiming to get back as quick as possible or work together to have a cover and pressing defender, once the defending team gets the bal they play forward, run forward, and play quickly.

• When in possession, players should always try to play through, around or over the press.

· To prevent the opposition from playing through them easily, the defending team should focus on compactness and covering, and supporting one another when pressing, as these are the key components of a good transition into attack.

· The team in possession should try to stretch the opposition so that space and gaps appear to play into.

This session was created with a set of specific, real-game scenarios in mind and

aims to answer the following question:

• How can a team set itself up for an effective transition after losing the ball?

• How can the team set itself up for an effective transition after winning the ball?

• Press and cover and decision making.

Part 1: 6(4)v2: quick Transition Rondo

In terms of playing quickly when in attacking transition, this is a possession rondo with quick transition players where 1 will be attacking and one will be defending and switching roles.

Organization

• 2 boxes created with a gap in between. As big or as narrow depending on the size of the team.

• Split players into two

• Add 2 smaller goals to the end corners of each box.

Explanation

· The team which starts with possession must complete 5 passes before scoring the mini goals.

· Only 2 player (depending on difficulty more) from the defending team my enter the opposition’s box.

· The goal for the defending team is to get the ball and quickly transition it to their players on the side for a counter or quick transition of play. They also must complete 5 passes before scoring.

· The attacking team must send two players to the opposition team quickly to recover the ball.

· Small goal 2 point medium goal 1

📷

Part 2: quick transition 2v2

In terms of playing quickly when in attacking transition, this game will be consist of a 2v2 depending on quickness could be a 2v GK.

Organization

• A channel is created along each side of the 18 year box.

• Split players into two

• Add 2 medium goals at an angle by the 18 year line where the coaches are standing.

Explanation

· Only 2 player from each side will start, they must do a quick 3 series passes and shoot at the medium size goal.

· Once shot is taken they must quickly make it inside of the box where the coach will pass it to a random team and create a 2v2 situation.

· If one team is slower the coach can decided to do an early pass to the team that is ready and other team must quickly get ready or it will be a 2 v GK.

· medium goal 1 point big goal 1

📷

📷

Part 3: quick transition 2v1 / 2v1/2v2

In terms of playing quickly when in an attacking transition, this game will be consist of a 2v2 depending on quickness could be a 2v1 + GK.

Organization

• Split players into two

• Add 2 medium goals at an angle by the 18 year line where the coaches are standing.

Explanation

· Only 2 player from each side will start

· Defending team will do a pass to the diagonal attacker

· Defender will quickly try to get into the box to stop the attack.

· Attacker will quickly come inside as pairs to create a 2 v 1.

· Second defender will need to run back and cut behind the cone once the ball has been passed and quickly gets into position.

· Both defenders must work together to stop the attack.

· 1 point for attacker if they get a shot on the goal and goal keeper saves. 2 points for scoring.

· 1 point for defender for clearing the ball 2 points for scoring the in the medium goals. (pass to a number 7 or 11)

I don't know if this is the correct place to ask about this, but I do need help in discerning my application to an online masters. I have completed a rather rigorous bootcamp in data analytics (programming w/ python) to a successful degree (and will continue to complete the academny's nanodegree in the near future) (This academy is one of the more reputable ones in my city.

). The academy has advised me that after I complete the course, I should apply for an online masters, and it listed Georgia Tech as a good choice.

However, there is one major issue that I am dealing with and that is my grades at university. (I am being super vulnerable here, so please be a bit more gentle and tactful and not bash me for a mistake I made years back). I left uni 2 years ago, and my gpa, translated to a US score is roughly around 2.5/2.6/4.0 scale.. (It was the roughest patch of my life, and graduating in itself was a huge miracle already, plus there were some dumb admistrative errors that I made that pushed my score down).. I know myself how horrible it is (compated to Georgia's 3.0/4.0 requirement), but since then I've pushed myself out of this hole and am working hard to be in a better place........

Is it worth applying still to the course, or should I just forget about it? Some background stuff (that may boost my application) is the nanodegree I am on my way to completing (though I am uncertain if it will be recognized by the University), and more coding projects that I am about to try doing .. I might also apply for it after I land an intership/start working in D.A. too... what do you all think."

I have a small project I need help with.

I am using Data Factory to help synchronize our HR Management system in order to create user accounts. Fairly simple. Until we get a better HR solution I need to do it piecemeal.

When an employee is added to the HR System, the application sends an email notification in which I have them saved as text files in a storage account.

The text file has fields:

Employee Name: John Doe

Employee ID: 012345

Job title: Assembler

Supervisor ID: 024682

Supervisor Name: Kyle Smith


A few more fields here and there. My plan was to have data factory grab these files, extract the fields from them and their values, and consolidate them into one CSV file that I can use to create user accounts and such.

I don’t know how to ask google properly, and the results I get are for things like extracting values from file names or metadata. Not what I’m looking for.

Can someone point me in the right direction to get something working? 

Each text file is one record, and in each text file are strings I want to extract and derive columns from them. 

Think of them as each file acts like a separate record, and each file has columns eliminated by lines.

Hope I explained it clearly.

3,Need insight on my IT career and boss situation,r/it,Vegetable-Squash1918,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/it/comments/1lqbr7l/need_insight_on_my_it_career_and_boss_situation/,"Really need help/advice as a I am utterly confused and dying for some clarity.

I work for a small IT firm, about 12 people employed. I have been with them since 2019. I started out as an entry level 1 support technician, with some occasional onsite duties.

I have two bosses; the owner, and the Service Manager.

For the last 2/3 years I've been bumped up to level 2 duties, but no increase in pay other than my normal yearly review increase (around 3-4% each time around). Never was given a new set of job duties either.

I undertook this and used it as an opportunity to learn more deeply into IT work/better my knowledge.

The last year or so, it's been thrown at me that they want to promote me to Lead Tech, I would essentially have 6 guys working underneath me and I would be the project manager as well.

Today I had my yearly review with the service manager, let's call him John. John sat down with me for about and hour, had a worksheet with questions where he would ask the typical questions, where can you improve/what are you strengths/whats your plans etc.

Three or four months prior to this, the CIO of my company said that I am the new Tech Lead, and that I am to start assuming the role; the promotion wouldn't be instant, but wants me to start doing it, and by this time (review time, in other words, today) I would be discussed the increase in pay and also the official job duties.

That didn't happen.

We just recently finished a big project for a client of ours, where it was my responsibility to lead 3 other techs into upgrading one of our clients offices to a new laptop/DS/monitor setup. I spearheaded this project and ensured it happened 100% without mistake. I was praised for this. However...

John then says, even though he was impressed with the work, he feels that I am ""not a Tech Lead yet"" because he feels I ""wasn't showing enough leadership"" and he would like to see more. His reasons being:

\- He typed up the master checklist for the project in Excel (something he offered to do)  
\- That he counted the amount of equipment we needed to bring to the new office  
\- That he arranged for our intern (one of the 3 people working with me) with equipment he needed to do a follow up visit after the project (to smooth out any small kinks)

Forget that I did the following:

\- Trained all of them how to set up new laptops in Azure AD and Intune (deploy apps, change ownership of PC, sec groups, etc)  
\- Trained them how to use our automate software to deploy printers/peripherals  
\- Wrote out a checklist for each laptop to ensure we followed every step from x-fering data from old machine to new Azure laptops  
\- Helped the intern, while PUMPING endless service tickets in the office at the same time, unboxing and prepping all laptops before the move  
\- Helped other techs who were not involved with their tickets/problems/issues  
\- Kept contact with the client and planned everything accordingly with them to ensure smooth process

John was one of the people on my team, I also was given the authority to task John with things to do while we were onsite. I would often ask him to do things, and he barely lifted a finger, spent most of his time telling my team what to do/bark orders, got an attitude with me on 3 different occasions, and spent a lot of time flirting with our young, Eastern European contact with the client (while he's married, and didn't even get her phone number, lol)

So John tells me that I am not being promoted yet, they want me to continue assuming the role, all these extra slapped on responsibilities, managing projects, AND doing the most amount of service tickets in the office of any of the techs, while saying ""once I see that leadership, we will soon have another meeting where I can double-dip your salary increase.

I am also doing more onsite than I ever have before. We are onboarding more clients than we can keep up with. There are some clients we haven't fully onboarded for over a year after them signing with us. The onsite is killing my vehicle fast, I get compensated for it, but we are supposed to take turns each tech each month. They now have me doing my month, plus additional onsites when needed, usually when the dispatch and John are F'ing up the scheduling.

So, he only ended up giving me 4% raise (45,000 to 47,000 base pay), I get 1,500 bonuses each quarter if I meet certain criteria (which I have been getting thus far). In 2025, especially for the hours of work I put in, almost overtime every day, just to get things done and rolling.... I feel like I am being majorly stiffed, and being forced to work extra duties for free without compensation. And for how long? An undefined amount of time? They already promised it to me 3-4 months ago.

Am I being fucked? Is this normal practice? Am I being strung along/carrot dangled? My gut keeps telling me to quit and that there is something malicious going on, but at the same time, I don't know if it's just me not understanding how this all works, or if I am being taken advantage of.

Tell me what you think, and tell me how you think I should handle this situation. I will answer any questions if you need more information on something."

After much time passed i latter discovered windows compatability mode for either option circumvented the issue, but it got really annoying having to configure it in the launcher's options everytime it updated, plus some apps don't support it so they are permanently glitche untill i fix this for real.

**I could really use some help figuring this out.**

**I’m using a ThinkPad Universal USB-C Dock connected to my MacBook Air 2020 (M1 chip). I’m using a UGREEN USB4 Gen3 240W cable to connect the dock to the Mac.**

**The issue is that the dock behaves inconsistently:**

**Sometimes it displays my external monitor just fine, and other times nothing happens — it’s like the Mac doesn’t detect the display at all.**

**Same with power — sometimes it charges both the Mac and other devices connected to the dock (like phones via USB-A), and sometimes it doesn’t charge anything.**

**I’ve tried switching USB-C ports on the Mac, unplugging/replugging the cable, restarting the dock, etc., but I can’t find a clear pattern for when it works or doesn’t.**

**The cable is brand new, supports USB4 and 240W, so I assume it should be high quality and fully compatible.**

**Has anyone run into something like this before?**

I recently have been building a weekly startup idea newsletter called ExplodingIdeas.co and got my first 1,000 subscribers in 12 days!

I used 0 paid ads! All subscribers were totally free!

Fast forward to the end for the takeaways...

## Backstory
Since January I have been testing out new side hustle/business ideas. I essentially start with a landing page (coded in nextjs) and try out different ideas on the landing page template i’ve built. The landing page has a high conversion rate so I just templatized it for all the different ideas I tested. 

Here are some of the business ideas I've tested since January. 

Podcast advertising marketplace
AI Chrome Extension
NFT analytics website SaaS
Discord newsletter signup bot

I killed all of those ideas. None of them had the momentum that I hoped for to consider success. The AI chrome extension went viral on reddit and indie hackers but it was hype driven and I only got around 150 active users (about 1,100 web visitors). For the other ideas I got a couple signups here and there but nothing overwhelming, til now. 

Disclosure: I have had a couple successful bootstrapped businesses in the past. I sold one, and still hold the other. The one that I currently hold takes advantage of a market inefficiency that I was able to identify through market research 5 years ago. I tested it with $50 and it’s now pretty sizable. When testing new ideas I fully bootstrap them, meaning I’m not propping them up with money I've made in other areas of my life, I find that gives a false sense of success that is unsustainable. Instead, I give myself a budget of under $1000 to test the market and I do not promote to users of other businesses I have. The product needs to stand 100% on its own and be bootstrappable. This product specifically was tested for $60.07. I bought Gsuite, an email address, 2 web domains (wasn’t sure which to go with). I did all the art design etc. myself mostly using the free tier on midjourney AI. I went to college for music so i’m not a school trained programmer, I just learned design, code etc. online over the last few years.

## The Idea
Basically I am always looking for new ideas to test and potentially build businesses around. I subscribe to trends, meetglimpse, trendhunter, semrush etc. 

My biggest issue with the current players out there is that for me they lean into content that I don’t care about (pushing their facebook communities, community member interviews etc) and the content is just not strong enough. The amount of market research I do on a project by project basis is way deeper than these products offer. I need deep research with serious thought behind it if I'm going to test a new idea, not surface level ideas with 5 minutes of research.

A few years ago I worked for a large fortune 500 corporate company and at one point the CEO backed one of my business ideas internally (I got no equity unfortunately). I was then promoted to focus 100% of my time at the company writing business proposals about different market opportunities we could exploit and would pitch them at a sporadic cadence to the Chief Counsel and executive team. So I've done market research before for myself successfully, as well as for a major organization successfully. (for those wondering, I started at that company as a temp, I learned how to put together market research from reading a lot of books, interviews, youtube and just listening in company meetings).

So I decided to test this new idea out to see if others were interested too. I essentially decided I could provide market research on business ideas in emerging niches and put it out for people to read. 

## Testing
To test the idea I went into side hustle Facebook groups and posted about the site. Some of the communities on Facebook are super large, though they’re mostly unengaged. 

I decided to make the logo when shared yellow so that when it’s on someone's newsfeed they notice it immediately. I hoped that would increase engagement a bit. I also tried posting memes with my content but that didn’t work super well as it looked too much like an ad.

I posted about the website in about 10 facebook groups and got 37 signups by the next day. The facebook groups had 50k-100k members.

Over the next week I took about an hour each day to join Facebook groups relating to side hustles, online businesses etc. and would make some posts. This quickly started getting momentum. 

I had a business friend whom I sometimes collaborate with share on indiehackers and reddit, he sometimes helps me on projects and is considering joining this project. 

This technique of posting in groups and forums was pretty successful. People naturally engaged and checked out the website. 

This amounted to getting 1,000 subscribers in the first 12 days. 

## Why it worked
So here’s why I think it worked…

- Appeals to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs
- Economic downturn beneficiary
- Meaningful TAM

So #1 I find the best ideas historically appeal to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. This means your product should appeal to helping people find love, making money or another core fundamental need that humans desire. In this case, people want to make more money so they may want to create a new business or side hustle. 

2 is that whenever there’s an economic downturn these hierarchical needs become exacerbated. Meaning, people lose their jobs and so they must figure out how to make more money. Downturns impact people's fundamental needs. They may no longer be able to afford their house, they may struggle to put food on the table etc. It’s harsh but there is an obvious shift in attention whenever there is an economic downturn. 

3 There’s a large population that has an interest in building a side hustle and/or business. I had a successful software website in the past that I bootstrapped and had instant product market fit on Reddit but the biggest issue was that it had such a limited TAM. It was too niche to a fault. This really limited the amount of attention it was able to get. Therefore I had to get out of it. This has the potential to appeal to a greater audience. 

## The Lesson
If you want to bootstrap something you need high momentum. 

I read a book by LA Reid (music executive) who talked about signing Justin Bieber and that being the first time in his career he felt momentum like that. Kids would show up in troves at the mall for a chance to see Bieber. LA Reid had been working in music for 10+ years prior to this point. The natural pull that the world had towards Bieber was something he never experienced before. 

The goal is to strive for the same feelings in your business. The world should pull for it. It should not be a push from your end, but a pull from their end. 

This is just a matter of re-rolling the dice. Don't settle for boring ideas that are slogs and the world doesn't care about. The world will tell you when you have something epic. I've had multiple profitable online businesses and the common theme is the ones that takeoff always cost &lt;$100 to get product/market fit and take only a few weeks to get there. 

Sometimes my ego gets hurt when I put out an idea and no one likes it. Or I went way too over budget putting it together. But at the end of the day self awareness is your best friend and by holding onto a bad idea to save an ego you're the one that pays for it sooner or later (either in time or in money). 

Anyways, pursue momentum driven ideas. Keep re-rolling until you hit something where you can feel the momentum.

3,Need Help: Contract Dispute with Ghost Kitchen Company – Now Facing $52K Collection Claim,r/legaladvice,Adept-Current2707,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1lue3wm/need_help_contract_dispute_with_ghost_kitchen/,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for legal guidance regarding a dispute with a virtual kitchen provider I worked with in 2023. I signed a contract, paid a $7,000 deposit, and opened a ghost kitchen. I only operated for less than a month because I received no orders through their system, and saw other businesses closing around me.

A manager told me this was a “low season” and that things would improve by winter, but I couldn’t afford to wait. I shut it down early. Later, that same manager messaged me saying that the company would settle for $10,000 (split into 3 payments) instead of charging me for the full year, and that my deposit wouldn’t be refunded.

Then, months later, I was contacted by a debt collection agency saying I owe $52,000 — which seems to be the full value of the original 12-month contract.

I’m currently looking for a free consultation with a lawyer in New Jersey, and want to know if I have any grounds to dispute this — especially since I never received any orders, only used the kitchen for a few weeks, and have proof of what the manager told me.

Any advice, experience, or legal direction would be deeply appreciated.

Thank you.

3,"Water bill tripled, need help",r/legaladvice,spiritedawayfox,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1lu4ssm/water_bill_tripled_need_help/,"Location: Conroe, TX

I know this might seem like something not even worth the effort to get legal advice for, but here it is. I started living at my apartment complex in August of last year. For the time I've lived here, my water bill was under $20. It makes sense; I live alone and I take very quick showers. I really don't use much water every day. 

Here's the kicker: starting in maybe January or February, my water bill shot up to almost $60. My water use has not changed a single since I started living here. I've looked up the water price changes and as far as I know, I am still being overcharged. I feel like I am paying for water I do not use in any capacity. I have gone back and forth with them about this issue is this is what they have said: 

""Price increase per the city of Conroe due to all the new development. The apartments do not increase your water/sewage amount; it is Allocated per unit therefor depending on the square footage of your dwelling, and it depend s on how many occupants are in your unit, how many times any amount of water goes into any drains. The Apartments are not in charge of your water/sewage fees.""

And again: 

""As stated in the previous message price increase per City of Conroe due to all of the new development. They have also increased sewage pricing. The Apartment Complex does not increase the price of the water/sewage amount. It is allocated per unit therefor depending on the square footage of your dwelling, and it depend s on how many occupants are in your unit, how many times any amount of water goes into any drains. The Apartments are not in charge of your water/sewage fees. We do not get to choose who gets to pay what, we have absolutely no way of doing it that way.""

This completely contradicts the account I got from the City of Conroe, where I spoke to an employee. They said I needed to talk with the complex because they are the ones who get the bill for the entire complex then divide it up amongst the residents.

Can someone with knowledge of this field (utilities, water management companies, apartment complexes) please help me figure out what is going on? And if the bill makes sense considering CoC water price increase into the new year, or if my apartment is full of shit? I just need to know whether or not to get my attorney involved. I know it's $40 but I live alone and work hard for my money. I'm not going to pay for water that I'm not using. I think that's understandable regardless of how much extra I'm paying.


One other piece of background information: my apartment was investigating a leak in my building a few months ago, roundabout when the bill got tripled. They say it has been resolved and is unrelated but I'm not convinced."
3,Need Help Understanding Lease Renewal Rules (NYC - Co-Tenant Not Renewing),r/legaladvice,anandamid23,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1lu28rs/need_help_understanding_lease_renewal_rules_nyc/,"Hey all, 

I’m trying to renew my lease in NYC as the sole tenant because my co-tenant is moving out. The management company is now asking me to go through a new approval process and resubmit updated guarantor paperwork—even though both my guarantor and I were fully approved *individually* during the original lease signing 2 years ago. I’ve reviewed the lease and don’t see any clause requiring a new application just because one co-tenant chooses not to renew. From what I understand, NYC standard practice allows landlords to request updated income, but not impose a full re-approval unless adding a new person. Am I missing something here, or is this excessive? Would love to hear from anyone who's been through something similar or knows the legal basis for this.

Thank you all!

So i have now over a length of roughly 2.5 - 3.0 years have had the following happen to me now 3 times! It has left me extremely anxious and worried and scared literally at all times of the day and night since these occurances. Here is what happened:

Police come to where I had been visiting a friend, stating I had an arrest warrant issued on me and that I was to be taken into custody. At the time of this, I was infact an addict of different types of opiates and opioid medications, ie. Legally prescribed oxy of 2 different strengths. also Clonzepam. Also unfortunately at the time of these incidents i was using heroine as well. Thank fully i can state now that i am currently clean off of all said from above for now going on for 11months.  At time of arrest I was myself attempting to cold turkey to get clean which was why I was at my friend's. IN route to jail I apparently suffered from a severe seizure and just remember awakening in a hospital. Not sure what or why was happening I fell out of conscienceness again. Apparently the ER staff had administered various medications to stabilize me. Once I awoke hours later, I was in a hospital room, alone, in a bed and gown, no medical staff, no police or any sort of cop detail anywhere in sight. I was not connected to any sort of monitors or any iv lines or anything at all. To my side was a chair that had my clothes at time of the arrest thoughtlessly tossed on the chair and floor. Immediately upon gaining enough mind to realize I was able to get up and leave far as I could tell, I did just that! When I did I was literally in a wing of the hospital that was completely empty! Not 1 PERSON OR STAFF OR ANYONE was around. was ultimately able to find my way to exit and found a young lady to aid me in a ride back to my friend's. Now roughly a year or so later essentially the exact same thing almost to a T Occurred! Same damn thing..taken to be placed into custody at a jail, in route had to go to.hospital and after ward was myself found to be have been abandoned there without any notice or letter of.care or stating to my family.and emergency contacts. Then this last time, they come to my location. I mean like 10 deep. Have ar15. Rifles. A mean freaking dog. They take all occupants, a 71yr old sick and ailing women, a 52yr old son of hers and her other son of some few years older then the other. Then myself. They camsack the house. All the while.we are outside in Cold demanding the warrant and wanting to know why they are there. No warrant was ever shown or given up to us. Was stated it was a “digital warrant. “ then they took me aside and tried to ask me questions about.some miscellaneous random completely unconnected things of illegal nonsense. All of which I had no knowledge or anything to help them with there in. Then while in handcuffs, they take me, and I quote, “ let's go to the van to run one last check real fast before we take off to jail ok. “ at that point in time im removed from.handcuffs and stated that there is infact no warrant and there must of been some clerical type error. Then they all leave.

Im now CONSTANTLY afraid at all hours and times that i.can be just taken away for no reason! To be unknowingly placed into some questionable custody and just left someplace. Im scared. Im very shaken about.this and need help and advise. please! Anyone!"
3,My mother is trying to take/sell my camper for protecting my daughter. What can I do?,r/legaladvice,Ok-Physics-5357,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ltkec5/my_mother_is_trying_to_takesell_my_camper_for/,"
Location: Kentucky 

Title is in Tennessee 

I'm currently living and an apartment and am unhappy where I'm living at and even believe it's making my daughter, partner, and I sick. My mother offered me a job to help take care of a client who lives with her through a job called PDS. She offered to buy me a camper and I told her I would pay her monthly for it until it was paid off. (8,500) But here's the catch. 

My mother married my childhood SAers cousin when I was in my early 20s. Which means my childhood abuser is up there every single day. This isn't only bad for my mental health, but I also have a daughter and I will not tolerate him being around her at all and she knows this.
She's know this since before my daughter was even born. (She's almost 3)


  I told her I wouldn't agree to her buying the camper until she assured me that he wouldn't be up there. I told her That he could even meet her husband at the bottom of the hill if he needed a ride (which was her excuse for him being up there)

She was hesitant at first but then agreed that he wouldn't be back up on that hill if I got that camper. 
That she was even about to tell her husband to leave because he calls mine and my brother kids ""bastards"" and tell her we use her for money and gets angry anytime we need help. Mind you she pays all his bills and even bought a ""clubhouse"" for a biker gang that he is in.  Her husband even makes messed up remarks about her childhood abuse on top of everything else.


I told her I would absolutely leave a soon as I saw him (my abuser)  up on that hill and made that very clear. 
She agreed, promised me several times and I bought the camper with her money. 

Mind you. Because my mother is untrustworthy, I signed the title and had my stepmother hold it for me until I could have it transferred into my name. 

As soon as the camper was on her property, everything changed. She told me that I wasn't going to boss her around on her property or tell her who she could and couldn't have up there. 

She texted me the next day telling her I needed to get the camper off her property, then said never mind that she was going to sell it. That I no longer had a job and since I couldn't pay if off because she fired me, she was getting her money back by selling it. She told me to go find a job where I could disrespect and boss them around because she wasn't doing it. She is also taking my only dependable car that's in her name. 

 She is also telling everyone that I was ""coached"" into believing i was abused to cover up and afair like HOW does that even make sense. Also. My abuser also Got his STEPDAUGHTER (my cousin) pregnant while she was a minor and my mother's excuse for that was that ""she was served to him on a platter"" 

So I am out a home, my job, and my only dependable car because she's angry that I held her to her word about keeping my child safe. 

If anyone has advice on what I should do please let me know. My name is signed on the title but in order to transfer states I have to have the camper inspected and she will most likely call the law on me if I have it moved from her property.

I have most of this in text and proof she agreed not to have the man up there, that she bought it for me and that I could pay it off. Also have where she told me I couldn't work for her to pay it off anymore due to ""disrespect"" 

I've already been officially hired on the job that she is refusing me and only worked 1 shift before she ""fired"" me. Idek if she can do that or if that is the clients legal guardians rights. 

I can't help but to think she was trying to trap me into being in a place I didn't feel safe for my daughter and I. 

I'm disturbed and hurt and all around broken I need advice.

3,Need help gaining permanent guardianship (or custody?)of my 17yo brother,r/legaladvice,Secure-Background734,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ltam0g/need_help_gaining_permanent_guardianship_or/,"Location: Georgia 
Hi there, I’m hoping someone might can help me with an issue I have. My brother who’s currently 17, was kicked out of my aunt and uncles house due to him running away because of the way they parent. He was found the next day and they forced him to take a drug test, which came back positive for weed due to being exposed to secondhand smoke from the friend whose house he ran away to (he spent the night was all).  My mother passed in 2021 and they were granted permanent guardianship of him around that time. The aunt and uncle arranged for him to come live with me after this and stated that he could not stay with them anymore. They also have tried to arrange for the termination of their guardianship so I can be granted it but it was denied. He has been living with me for around 2-3 months, gets SSI and child support income from my deceased mother and his out of the picture dad. Me and my wife were looking to gain permanent guardianship over him instead, and were looking at possibly just getting a petition to modify the existing permanent guardianship and change it to us instead of them. The only problem is, we can’t seem to find any petition to file with our probate court for that, so we’re all at a loss for now. The probate courts in both counties me and my wife as well as my aunt and uncle have been no help in getting us the right petitions, they’ll tell us to go to the website and find it (which I understand because of legality, but still) Any help would be MUCH appreciated. He has been living with us since around the end of May 2025. "
3,Was hit and run on my motorcycle.,r/legaladvice,Fresh-Possibility754,1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1lt8v06/was_hit_and_run_on_my_motorcycle/,"So this last Thursday night, right at dusk I was riding home from the gas station and this car turned out of the median lane directly into me while I was traveling on a highway about 60 mph. I was just barely able to swerve but in doing so the car clipped my foot, fracturing my heel bone, breaking my big toe, and leaving a big chunk of fragments in my heel. I’ve always been a physical guy, I love to be outdoors. I can hardly even get myself to the car now. I was transported in the ambulance and when I was telling the police the cars info they acted as if they couldn’t even go look? I’ve given them businesses with cameras to check and I’ve heard nothing back the last 3 days. I’m at the point I’ll go and ask myself. I need to find this person who hit me. They ruined my entire 1st year of riding motorcycles and quite frankly could impact the rest of my life.

Another thing I would like to bring to attention is when I was in the ER, my nurse was trying way too hard to be funny, but it came off as rude to me. She kept joking about putting me on all these drugs, she told me to chew up an oxycodone for it to kick in faster. I just felt like they took me as a joke. Not to mention at first I was told it was just a really bad sprain and they were about to send me home immediately until I demanded them to take a CT since the X-RAY didn’t show much. I’ll leave exam notes below. Anyone know how long I might be unable to walk? Or possibly do I have a malpractice case on my hands for the way the nurse talked to me? Any advice would be so appreciated, I am only 20 years old and parents aren’t in the picture so I really need help. Thanks.

3,[Feedback Request] Local coffee shop promo campaign — need help to turn eyeballs into real sales,r/marketing,glassybrick,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1lty0h3/feedback_request_local_coffee_shop_promo_campaign/,"Hi everyone,

I’m working solo as a marketer for a **local chain of coffee shops**. We’re about to launch a high-visibility campaign with:

* a colorful, catchy **promo video** (already produced),
* showing in **cinemas**, **shopping mall LED screens**, and
* shared through our **social media** accounts.

The final seconds of the video lead to a **promo offer** to encourage visits and repeat purchases. But I’m stuck choosing the right *mechanic* for that offer — and need your help.

Here are two concepts I pitched:

**Concept 1 – “Register your receipt to enter”**

&gt;

**Concept 2 – “Come meet someone special”**

&gt;

I need a **trigger** — something that:  
✅ Converts campaign attention into visits and sales  
✅ Doesn’t sound like cheap “free coffee” gimmicks  
✅ Still allows us to collect receipts via the Telegram bot for retargeting  
✅ Feels aligned with a “warm community café” brand

Has anyone faced this before? Any promo ideas, reward structures, or angles that worked for your local F&amp;B clients? I’m open to totally different directions too.

Thanks in advance 🙏"

I’m a full-time ad manager (Facebook &amp; Google) looking to scale a side hustle via cold email. Here’s the lean setup I’m testing (\~$200/mo):

* Main domain + 2 extra sending domains
* Google Workspace (or Zoho) per domain
* Cold-email tool (Instantly/Smartlead)
* Lead scraper (Clay)
* CRM in Notion
* Simple credibility site (Wix/Webflow/WordPress)

Plan: Warm domains, then send \~100–200 emails/day offering FB/Google ad management to local SMBs (plumbers, HVAC, pest control, etc.). I’ve got solid case studies ready.



Has anyone tried a similar cold-email approach to land ad management clients? What worked, what didn’t, or any tweaks you’d recommend? Am I missing something essential for Month 1?



Appreciate any insights!"

I have always wanted to work in fashion marketing, specifically on the digital side. Over my college career, I became increasingly interested in social media and was looking forward to finding a job in social media marketing within the fashion industry(in NYC). after applying to hundreds of jobs, I finally got a few interviews for some internships. I am now juggling between two offers and I need help making a decision. **Option #1** is a 6-month internship at a social media marketing agency that has a very high chance of becoming a full time position, as long as my performance is well received. I do like the idea of working at an agency and learning about different companies and brands, but this position is not fashion specific, although they do work with some fashion brands. **Option #2** is an internship with no official end date, I was told depending on tariffs, budget, and my performance, there is a tentative opportunity for a full time offer in the future. This internship is a junior social media manager position for a small but well regarded shoe brand. This experience is less structured but is more fashion specific. Both options have basically the same hours and salary. They both have no benefits as they are both internships. I want to make the best decision for my career, but I am unsure. What should I do? "

I’m a backend developer with solid experience in Java, Python, and their respective frameworks. I’ve worked on building scalable microservices, APIs, and cloud-based systems. Currently, I’m working full-time, but I’m looking to take on freelance/remote side projects that can earn me an additional ₹50,000–₹60,000 per month (around $600–$750).

Why I’m looking:
I’m the sole earner in my family, and while my full-time salary covers our living expenses, I’m now planning to buy a house for my family. I need to save aggressively, and freelancing seems like the best way forward.

What I can offer:
	•	4.5+ years of backend development experience
	•	Strong command over Java (Spring Boot) and Python (FastAPI/Django)
	•	Experience with AWS, REST APIs, microservices, SQL/NoSQL DBs
	•	Good with debugging, writing clean code, and following SOLID/OOP principles
	•	Comfortable working with Git, CI/CD, and scalable systems

What I need help with:
	•	What platforms are best for finding freelance backend gigs? I’ve started exploring weworkremotely.com but I’m not sure how to position myself for freelance opportunities there.
	•	Should I learn any specific tools/skills that are in high demand in freelancing (e.g. Node.js, DevOps, frontend techs)?
	•	How can I stand out and build trust as a reliable part-time freelancer?

Any tips, platforms, or referrals would be really appreciated. I’m serious about contributing quality work and building a strong freelancing track record.

Thanks in advance!

3,Seeking New Horizons: A Creative Professional's Journey need help to Remote Work and Well-being,r/remotework,desowl,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1lj66sx/seeking_new_horizons_a_creative_professionals/,"Hey everyone,



My name is Arif, and I'm reaching out from Malaysia. I'm a senior graphic designer who has been in the creative industry since 2011, and honestly, I'm just…tired. I'm currently on a month of unpaid leave because I've hit a wall with burnout. The constant rush of last-minute projects and those endless 12-14 hour days really just broke me down. As an adult with autism, my brain gets overwhelmed and exhausted easily when I'm hyper-focused, and it's been incredibly hard to manage the emotional toll of such a high-stress environment.



I'll be turning 40 next year, and I desperately need a change. I've lost my passion for graphic design, and I really need to find a new path, a new way to earn an income that doesn't cost me my health. As the sole provider for my family, my well-being is everything, and I want to be around for them for a long, long time. Right now, my savings just aren't cutting it for the long term, so finding a stable income source is crucial.



I've spent this past month trying to find remote work, and it's been a real struggle. I'm open to anything – part-time, freelance, contract, or even on a full-time basis – and I'm happy to consider entry-level or mid-level positions. My skills include:



Graphic Design: Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Canva, and a bit of Figma

Copywriting

Editing

Transcription

Microsoft Office



I even worked with Outlier for four months, and the pay was good, but then suddenly, all the tasks just… vanished. It was a tough blow.



I'm not asking for miracles, just a little bit of guidance, some light at the end of this tunnel. If anyone here has recommendations for online remote job platforms that are open to folks in Southeast Asia, especially for roles like AI trainers, I would be so incredibly grateful.



On a different note, I'm also really hoping to dive into selling digital products. If any of you have proven tips, techniques, or platform recommendations that have worked for you, please share! I'm ready to try anything and everything to find a new avenue.



Thank you so much for taking the time to read my incredibly long post. Any help or advice you can offer would truly mean the world to me."
