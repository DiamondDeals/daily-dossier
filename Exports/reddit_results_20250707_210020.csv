12,I Worked with many Small Businesses - Here Are the 5 Systems Every One Was Missing,CRM,adn_notion,44,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRM/comments/1lhlzdv/i_worked_with_many_small_businesses_here_are_the/,"Over the last 6 months, I did operational audits and built custom Notion systems for small businesses : solopreneurs, freelancers, service providers, and agencies.

Here’s the shocking pattern:
 Every single business  no matter the industry or size was missing the same 5 core systems.


 Gap #1: No Lead Follow-Up System

What I saw:
•Leads scattered across emails, phones, sticky notes
•No structured follow-up process
•60–80% of leads never contacted again

Fix:
✓ Central lead database
✓ Automated follow-up templates
✓ Conversion tracking by source
 Lost revenue: $2k–15k/month


 Gap #2: Project Scope Creep

What I saw:
•Verbal agreements with no clear documentation
•No standard kickoff or scope
•Constant “quick tweaks” destroying profit margins

Fix:
✓ Scope templates + client approval workflows
✓ Simple change request process
✓ Lost profit: 20–40% per project


 Gap #3: No Time/Profitability Tracking

•What I saw:
•No clue which services were profitable
•Gut-based pricing
•ndercharging for complex work

Fix:
✓ Real-time time tracking inside Notion
✓ Profitability dashboard
✓ Data-driven pricing

 Lost revenue: $500–3k/month


 Gap #4: Client Communication Mess

What I saw:
•Scattered email chains
•No centralized client history
•Reactive instead of proactive communication

Fix:
✓ CRM-style client dashboard
✓ Check-in tracker
✓ Feedback log

Lost clients: 2–5 per year


Gap #5: No SOPs or Knowledge Base

What I saw:
•Knowledge stuck in the founder’s head
•No repeatable workflows
•Team couldn’t take over anything


Fix:
✓ SOP builder inside Notion
✓ Step-by-step task docs
✓Delegation workflows

 Bottleneck: You can’t scale what only lives in your head.

 The Big Insight

Most business owners try to:
•Work longer hours
•Hire more people
•Try new marketing tricks

 But the truth is: Fix your internal systems first → then scale.


 The System I Built (for clients)

I turned all of this into a complete Notion workspace:
✓Lead Management
✓ Project Scope System
✓ Time + Profitability Tracker
✓ Client CRM
✓ SOP Builder


Which of these 5 gaps do you struggle with the most?

If you  are interested in these systems I’ll send  Exact same system  to you.  
Drop a comment with your biggest challenge I’ll suggest a system fix that worked for others.

11,"E-commerce Industry News Recap 🔥 Week of July 7th, 2025",ecommerce,adventurepaul,3,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1lu51jb/ecommerce_industry_news_recap_week_of_july_7th/,"Hi r/ecommerce \- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 4 years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon deployed its ONE MILLIONTH worker robot last week across its more than 300 facilities. The company also shared that its entire fleet will soon be powered by a newly launched generative AI model that will coordinate the movement of its robots within its fulfillment centers, reducing the travel time of the fleet by 10% and enabling faster and more cost-effective package deliveries. Plus they don't take bathroom breaks — which is something Amazon has always disdained about its human liabilities workers.
___
As part of the package introduced as the **“One Big Beautiful Bill Act,”** the U.S. will repeal the **de minimis exemption** allowing imports under $800 to enter the country duty and tax free on July 1, 2027. President Trump already ended the exemption for imports from China and Hong Kong in May, but now the bill extends the policy to all countries. Moving forward, parcels will be subject to more stringent inspection and different entry processes, with the Trump administration expected to provide details about what to expect at a later time. The bill also establishes a penalty for any person attempting to use de minimis entry in a way that “violates any other provision” of U.S. customs laws in the amount of $5,000 for the first violation and up to $10,000 for subsequent violations.
___
**Google** introduced **Offerwall**, a new tool that lets publishers offer readers alternative ways to access content and new ways for publishers to monetize their content, beyond traditional impression-based advertising or affiliate marketing. Options for accessing content include: Watching a video ad, Completing a survey, Making a micro payment, and Signing up to a newsletter. Google tested the offering with more than 1,000 publishers and has now made it generally available in Ad Manager. The company claims that publishers who have implemented Offerwall have seen an average revenue uplift of 9%.
___
**OpenAI** is expanding into high-ticket consulting, offering AI customization services starting at $10M to large companies and government agencies. Through a team of “forward deployed engineers,” OpenAI is offering to help clients fine-tune GPT-4o using proprietary data and build tailored applications that can solve problems specific to their needs, effectively creating their own custom ChatGPT portals. The consulting service already has buyers including large software firms and governments, according to The Information sources, with some clients agreeing to spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars over multiple years. OpenAI formed a dedicated consulting team earlier this year and has since hired around a dozen people for it, including several who previously worked at Palantir. A source told The Information that the goal of the division is to figure out whether OpenAI can develop technology that an enterprise customer would be willing to pay $1B or more for.
___
In response to **Meta** aggressively going after **OpenAI's researchers**, Sam Altman wrote a memo to all OpenAI researchers, pitching why staying at the company is the only answer for those looking to build artificial general intelligence and hinting that OpenAI is evaluating compensation for the entire research organization. He dismissed Meta's recruiting efforts, claiming that what the company is doing could lead to deep cultural problems in the future. He noted that despite trying for a long time, Meta has been unable to poach their ""top people."" He went on to make an emotional plea about how OpenAI is a mission-driven organization, even though it's simultaneously actively looking to convert into a for-profit organization. Lastly he slammed Mark Zuckerberg for jumping from one trend to another by saying, ""Long after Meta has moved on to their next flavor of the week, or defending their social moat, we will be here, day after day, year after year, figuring out how to do what we do better than anyone else.""
___
**President Trump** said on Friday that the U.S. “pretty much has a deal” for an American company to acquire the U.S. branch of **TikTok** and that he'll be restarting talks with China this week to approve it. Despite three extensions on the ban… a deal might actually be nearing. The Information reports that TikTok is building a new version of its app for users in the U.S., internally known as “M2,” with plans to launch to app stores on September 5th. Users would eventually have to download the new app to be able to continue using the service, but the existing app will work until March of next year. At this moment, it's unclear if ByteDance will share TikTok's algorithm with the U.S. buyers, license the algorithm, or deliver an amended version exclusive for the U.S. market. 
___
**Meta** announced several updates to its messaging and advertising offerings at its global “Conversations” conference in Miami on Tuesday including 1) centralized ad creation to build campaigns across WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, 2) WhatsApp buttons integrated with Google Business Profiles, 3) WhatsApp Order Tracking for Shopify, Woo, and other platforms, 4) direct calling for larger brands to be able to call back customers, and 5) tiered pricing for brands to scale up their usage (and payments to Meta). 
___
Last week Bloomberg reported that **Nintendo** pulled its products from Amazon-com after a disagreement over unauthorized sales, which resulted in **Amazon** missing out on the recent debut of Nintendo's Switch 2. The article said that Nintendo had noticed that third-party merchants were buying games in bulk in Southeast Asia and listing them for sale in the U.S. at prices that undercut Nintendo's advertised rates, and that despite Amazon's attempts to resolve the issue, Nintendo ultimately opted to pull its products from Amazon in the U.S. However both companies deny the allegations. Regardless, where are the Nintendo Switches?! Nintendo's website shows the Switch 2 available for sale on GameStop, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — but noticeably absent from that lineup is Amazon. Certain Switch titles like Donkey Kong Bananza are now appearing for pre-order on Amazon's U.S. website, but the Switch 2 device remains unavailable.
___
**OpenAI** introduced a new tool allowing retailers to create AI-powered shopping assistants in **Shopify** with just a few clicks. Using the Storefront Managed Compute Platform (MCP) and the OpenAI Responses API, developers can build agents that can: 1) Search products Answer product questions, 2) Explain differences between items, 3) Add items to a cart, 4) Generate checkout links. Users can enter prompts like, “I am looking for a tri suit for a cold weather triathlon,” and the assistant will search for options from the store's inventory to show the shopper. If the shopper picks one of the options, the assistant can automatically move to checkout.
___
**Google** is testing a price change rich result that indicates if the price is low, high, or typical, as spotted by Brodie Clark, an independent SEO Consultant. When clicking on the extension, a pop-up informs the user that insights are based on the last 90 days. The experiment appears to be an extension of the price drop rich result which has been detailed within Google's documentation for several years.
___
**eBay** is testing a feature that would allow buyers to scroll through multiple listing images directly on the search results page without needing to click through the listing page first. Some sellers have praised the move for improving the buyer experience, while others raised concerns that the new capability, along with eBay's vague Promoted Listing terms, could lead to more aggressive add attribution, possibly charging sellers for buyer interactions like swiping through the photo carousels. Others pointed out issues with the carousel skipping videos, overlapping key product details, and boosting visibility for competing listings through a “Find Similar” button. Can't please everyone!
___
**Amazon Business** is partnering with **Mathnasium**, the math tutoring franchise with more than 1,000 U.S. centers, to help locations procure classroom and operational supplies like toner, paper, and student incentives. The move aims to streamline purchasing, reduce admin tasks, and give centers access to bulk pricing and digital spend management tools. Since launching in 2015, Amazon Business has added more than 8M customers globally and reported $35B in annualized gross sales in 2023.
___
**Meta** is testing proactive AI chatbots that send unprompted follow-up messages to users in an effort to boost retention and engagement on its AI Studio platform, a no-code platform where anyone can build custom chatbots and digital personas that Meta launched in 2024, according to leaked documents viewed by Business Insider. The initiative, internally dubbed “Project Omni,” is being developed with contractor support from Alignerr, and allow bots to follow up with users up to 14 days after a conversation, but only if the user previously sent at least five messages.
___
**Alibaba** and **Wix** partnered to help entrepreneurs and small businesses expand globally. Wix merchants can now become Global Gold Suppliers on Alibaba via a new app integration, streamlining product syncing and access to millions of global buyers, while Alibaba sellers can use Wix’s AI-powered tools to build branded D2C and B2B storefronts. The partnership also enables Wix users to source products directly through a dedicated Alibaba wholesale marketplace, with AI-driven onboarding and product discovery tools to further simplify cross-border trade on the horizon.
___
**Perplexity** is [launching](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/perplexity-launches-a-200-monthly-subscription-plan/) a $200/month subscription plan for its power users called Perplexity Max, which offers unlimited access to its spreadsheet and report generation tool, Labs, and early access to new features like its upcoming AI-powered browser, Comet. Max subscribers will also get priority access to any Perplexity services using the latest LLMs like OpenAI o3-pro and Claude Opus 4. In 2024, Perplexity generated roughly $34M in revenue, mostly with its $20/month Pro plan, but still burned about $65M in cash due to heavy spending on cloud servers and buying access to AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic.
___
**A new AlixPartners survey** reports the biggest slowdown in online shopping in more than 10 years, with double-digit YoY declines across key categories like office supplies (-13%), sporting goods (-12%), and cosmetics, furniture, and electronics (each -10%). Tariff uncertainty and rising delivery and return costs are pushing retailers to tighten shipping perks and consumers to delay or reshuffle purchases, with 66% saying they’d switch to U.S. goods if overseas prices rise 10%.
___
**In corporate shakeups this week… DHL eCommerce** appointed Scott Ashbaugh, who currently serves as the company's Chief Commercial Officer, as its new Americas CEO, effective July 1st, following the retirement of Lee Spratt. **BigCommerce** appointed Anil Kamath, former Adobe Fellow and VP of Technology, to its board of directors. **Pattern** appointed Sue Taylor, former Chief Accounting Officer at Meta and LinkedIn, and Ann Mather, former Chief Financial Officer at Pixar, to its board of directors. And last but not least, **eToro** appointed Laura Unger, a former SEC commissioner, and Lior Shemesh, the CFO of Wix, to its board of directors.
___
**Microsoft** is laying off 9,000 workers, or about 4% of its workforce, mostly targeting salespeople and workers in the Xbox division, in its second major wave of layoffs this year, aiming to control costs while ramping up its AI spending. The terminations follow a round of layoffs in May that hit 6,000 people across product and engineering teams. Matt Turnbull, the executive produce at Xbox Game Studios, [took heat](https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt) for suggesting in a since-deleted LinkedIn post that affected employees should use ChatGPT and Copilot to “help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.”
___
**TikTok** is laying off more workers in its U.S. e-commerce division including moderation workers, product team members, and staff who work with creators and sellers, marking its third round of layoffs for that team since April. In a message to staff, the company said it's spent the past month assessing how to “best support our evolving global e-commerce business in alignment with our mission and evolving goals,” and that it's “repositioning resources and reducing complexity in pursuit of strengthened collaboration and increased efficiency.”
___
**Mirakl** and **Shopify** expanded their partnership with the release of the Mirakl Platform Connector for Shopify, aimed at helping large enterprises rapidly deploy and manage marketplaces. The connector is designed to reduce integration effort by up to 80% through prebuilt synchronization of taxonomy, products, sellers, and orders, and supports mixed 1P/3P checkouts, theme and headless storefronts, and real-time updates. Honestly, starting a marketplace has never been easier. We're about to enter the era of niche marketplaces.
___
**eBay** overhauled its tracking experience for both buyers and sellers, introducing a more visual and intuitive interface across Seller Hub and buyer shipment flows. The new system, which rolls out in late July, provides sellers with enhanced order tracking visualization and buyers with a unified delivery view, including separate tracking for outbound and return shipments. By offering clearer updates, especially on delays, eBay aims to reduce “item not received” claims, minimize customer service inquiries, and improve seller ratings and buyer trust.
___
**Walmart** released its 2025 Marketplace Seller Playbook, highlighting new tools and programs to help sellers scale across channels and international markets. Key initiatives include expanded Walmart Fulfillment Services, which the company says is now 15% cheaper than competitors, and a new Multichannel Solutions feature allowing sellers to fulfill orders from other platforms. The playbook also shares how new sellers can tap into up to $75,000 in savings, leverage Walmart Connect for 7x sales lift through ads, and access global markets like Canada, Mexico, and Chile, as well as details growth in categories like Premium Beauty, Collectibles, and Automotive, positioning Walmart as an increasingly competitive alternative to Amazon.
___
**Two upcoming New York state laws** are set to impact retailers: one requiring algorithmic pricing disclosure, which takes effect July 8, and another expanding return policy disclosure rules to online sellers, effective August 7, 2025. The National Retail Federation has sued to block the pricing law, arguing it unfairly stigmatizes dynamic pricing methods that often benefit consumers. Meanwhile, the updated return policy law mandates that online retailers clearly display or hyperlink their return terms near the product or before billing info is requested, aligning digital compliance with in-store standards.
___
**Shopify** launched App Bridge Reviews API, which lets app developers collect reviews directly from the merchant admin, as opposed to having to visit the app listing in the Shopify App Store. The move reduces friction for leaving reviews, which can ultimately improve review volume, helping both merchants and developers with additional feedback.
___
**Alibaba's Taobao** announced that it will be issuing $7B in subsidies over the next 12 months for certain purchases to boost consumption in China amid economic sluggishness and deflationary concerns. Rolled out over the next 12 months, the incentives include “red envelopes” (a digital form of cash gifts), product discounts, and reduced delivery and commission fees, particularly through Taobao’s “flash purchase” feature. The move aligns with broader government efforts to spark spending through policy stimulus, as the country grapples with a weak property sector, labor concerns, and ongoing trade tensions with the U.S.
___
**Zoho** unveiled Zoho Commerce 2.0, a fully redesigned and AI-enhanced e-commerce platform with new features including AI-generated product descriptions, abandoned cart recovery, loyalty programs, and BOGO-style coupon engines. The platform also now supports localized selling, WhatsApp Commerce, mobile apps, B2B functionality like quote requests and credit limits, advanced analytics, and multi-location fulfillment with carrier integration, with a redesigned interface that the company says is faster, cleaner, and more intuitive.
___
**Circle**, the issuer of USDC stablecoin that recently went public, applied for a national trust charter, which is a type of banking license issued in the U.S. that allows an institution to operate as a national trust bank, but without taking traditional deposits like a commercial bank. The charter, if approved, would create First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A., which would manage USDC reserves and offer digital asset custody for institutions. The move would align Circle with upcoming U.S. stablecoin legislation included in the GENIUS Act and follows Circle’s June IPO, which tripled its share price and boosted its valuation above $18B.
___
**Amazon** is now formally integrating its 16 Leadership Principles into employee evaluations using a new three-tiered rating system, as part of CEO Andy Jassy’s push for a more disciplined and performance-focused workforce, according to documents obtained by Business Insider. Starting this review cycle, corporate employees will be scored on how well they embody principles like “customer focus” and “cost discipline,” alongside performance and potential, to determine raises and performance plans, with only 5% of employees able to achieve the top “role model” rating. Wow, between return to office mandates, layoffs, relocations, and now leadership principle evaluations — Amazon sounds like a great place to work.
___
As tariffs drive up the cost of manufacturing, more brands are turning to **tariff engineering**, a legal strategy that involves tweaking product materials, features, or classifications, to reduce duty rates. There are currently more than 5,000 product classification codes used by over 200 countries when assessing tariffs, and small changes can make big differences in costs. Walmart, for example, has been working with suppliers to swap out materials like aluminum, which is subject to 50% tariffs, for alternatives like fiberglass. While effective, the practice carries legal risks if deemed purely evasive, as seen in Ford's $365M penalty for importing vans with added rears seats to avoid a 25% duty on cargo vehicles.
___
**TikTok Shop** officially launched in Japan, a market which has been dominated by Amazon Japan and Rakuten up until now. The app currently has over 33M monthly users in the country, with an average screen time of 96 minutes per day, according to the Japan External Trade Organization. Japan is TikTok Shop’s 17th market, following launches in the U.S., the UK, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam, among others, and introduces another Chinese player to the country’s e-commerce market, which already includes Temu and Shein.
___
**Reliance Industries**, the largest conglomerate in India with businesses spanning energy, petrochemicals, telecommunications, retail, and digital services, is transferring all of its consumer goods brands to a new wholly-owned subsidiary as it readies for an IPO for its retail business. The brands, spanning apparel, fashion, food, personal care, and beverages, will be moved to the new New Reliance Consumer Products Ltd (RCPL), allowing the capital-intensive consumer brands to attract a different set of investors.
___
**Australia's consumer regulator** put Shopify and Meta on notice, urging them to take action against online “ghost stores” that pretend to be local businesses to dupe shoppers. The agency issued a public warning about ghost stores on Thursday and announced it had written to the two companies after an investigation by Guardian Australia identified more than 140 of these websites. Meta said it would look into it, and Shopify has yet to comment.
___
**Bol**, the largest e-commerce marketplace in the Netherlands and Belgium, is now allowing sellers from outside the EU to join for the first time, with the first 100 non-EU sellers expected to onboard this year. The company emphasized strict quality control for offerings from countries such as China and made a rule that products must be stocked within Europe (ie: no direct-from-factory offerings like Temu). Bol first opened its doors to 3rd party EU sellers in 2011, and its network has since grown to over 50,000 sellers.
___
**France** imposed a €40M penalty on **Shein** for using “deceptive commercial practices towards consumers regarding price reductions,” following a year long investigation into the issue. That took a year? The French competition and anti-fraud office claims that Shein misled customers on price deals and on its environmental impact, particularly by raising prices on products before putting them “on sale” back to their original price. (Best Buy, are you paying attention?) In 57% of cases, Shein's advertised promotions actually offered “no price reduction” and in 19% of cases, the price drop was “less significant than announced.”
___
**FAST channels**, which are free, ad-supported streaming channels like those showing “Gunsmoke” or “Murder She Wrote”, are seeing up to a 50% drop in ad revenue this year, even as viewership continues to rise. The decline stems from a saturated ad market and growing competition from premium services like Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, which have begun selling ads themselves. On that note, Amazon announced that it is shutting down **Freevee** this August, its free streaming TV service that it launched in 2019 underneath IMDb, to concentrate exclusively on its free viewing options within its Prime Video app.
___
As **Amazon Prime Day** approaches on July 8th, NordVPN researchers have identified over 120,000 fake Amazon-related websites launched in the past two months, aiming to scam shoppers through phishing, malware, and counterfeit product schemes. The spike in impersonation scams represents an 80% increase during last year’s event — which I'm sure AI and the ease of launching websites has played a role in the uptick. Amazon urges shoppers to only verify purchases directly on its official site or app and warns that it never asks for payments by email, phone, or gift card.
___
**A Bitcoin miner** bagged a reward of 3.173 BTC ($349,028) by mining Bitcoin block number 903,883 late Thursday night. Solo CK, the non-profit service that enables Bitcoin miners to attempt to mine solo blocks, said that a miner of this size has about a 1 in 2,800 chance of solving a block every day, or once every 8 years on average. Lucky miner!
___
**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** An Indian software engineer named Soham Parekh was called out on X for working 3-4 jobs at a time (or possibly more), targeting YC companies. Other founders came out of the woodwork in the replies talking about how they had either hired or interviewed the guy at some point. The funniest reply said, “We had him on the team for about 3 months. He was confident and well spoken in meetings but hardly ever finished any of his work. Frequently other devs would step in to finish the task and get it shipped. The final straw was when he was caught masturbating on an all hands zoom call. He forgot his camera was on.” 
___
Plus 16 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Grammarly** acquiring **Superhuman**, an AI-powered e-mail client for business users that offers features like e-mail summaries, read status tracking, and follow-up reminders, for an undisclosed amount.
___
I hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!

11,DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the summary of how it's going after 17 months,juststart,kirilale,47,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1dea1pq/dataanalystcom_i_launched_a_niche_job_board_with/,"Hi all,

on Dec 19th I launched [DataAnalyst.com](http://DataAnalyst.com), and bringing you the 15th update on the progress.

Downsides of being a solo operator is when things get hectic in life, there will be a lot less time to spend projects. Missed the April update with day job going cray, but I'm back with a brief overview of April and May - it'll be a longer one, so pour yourself a cuppa and get comfy.

Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on.

While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/juststart might benefit from the site, especially those looking to start an online project on the side.

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.

[DataAnalyst.com](http://DataAnalyst.com) has been online for just over 17 months, and we're bringing new, hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site daily. As it stands, we've published over 2,300 data analyst jobs in total, all of them including a salary range.

# General Observations

Anyways, where were we....

Last time I was discussing the impact of the Google Core Update - March edition, and that it's finally hit DA as well.

Over April and May, it was just a continuation, with Google Search traffic going down, potentially showing some bottoming signs in May (but I'm not holding my breath). The site is still down appx 35-40% from the peak.

With that, it's also lost around 35% of keywords (from its peak) that the site was previously ranking for, now not showing up in results for those at all.

That's for the bad news.

For the good news, [DataAnalyst.com](http://DataAnalyst.com) has consistently showed up in the Top 6 search results for the ""data analyst jobs"" keyword.

That's just behind the LinkedIns, Indeeds, Glassdoors of the world.

I take that as a big win - with virtually $0 spend on content (my only expense is the tech platform), I'm pretty happy to see the site showing up so high in the resutls, means that something had to be done right.

Overall, even with the continuing massive Search engine ""I don't like you any more"" hit, we were still able to cross an all time high in terms of unique visitors, still contribute to almost 19,000 job applications made, and still grow our newsletter subscriber base.

So, where are people coming from?

# Newsletter horror

If you want to save money on sending emails, you'll probably go self-hosted, or be tempted to apply  discount on an upandcoming provider.

If you go self-hosted, you'll probably need to stay extremely on top of things (from technical authentications, trust signatures, configurations).

If you don't manage to stay on top of things, you'll discover pain.

In April, I've discovered pain.

Long story short, I'm back with the original provider, paying up.

# Speaking of paying up, Show Me The Money......

I still can't, simple as that.

Another 2 months, and crickets on the paid featured posts front.

Let's just have a look at the whole monetization topic, again... (if you've been reading my updates for the last year, you'll probably roll your eyes right now, I know I did)

There's around 5 main ways to monetize a job board.

a) Reverse job board

* candidates create profiles, companies pay for access to the pool, and then pay % commission on hire
* Example: RailsDev

b) Jobs aggregator

* AI scraping, benefits from in demand type of roles (remote), massive traffic being the differentiator and driver of inbound sales
* monetized by companies posting job opportunities
* Example: RemoteOK

c) Job board + services

* includes coaching, agency, recruiting in specific niche
* Example: KeyValues with engineers - job board acts as the top of the funnel, with main $$$ coming from additional services

d) Niche job board,

* monetized through employer payments
* own niche audience, sell jobs through inbound or outbound for better candidates
* Example: DA, Ranchwork, SeoJobs

e) Aggregate niche job board

* aggregate niche jobs en mass (API scraping)
* monetized through candidates, show X jobs for free, have candidates pay weekly/monthly/yearly to get access to all
* Example: RemoteRocketship, EchoJobs

I'm sure there are some other models, but I think this would cover majority.

From some of my conversations, and observations, I'd say that most models are currently struggling on the revenue side.

Primarily because of the shift in the job market - while 2020-2022 saw massive hiring and employees having the upper hand, 2023 onwards shifted to hiring freezes, layoffs and as it stands, companies are in control.

There's hundreds/thousands of qualified applicants applying to tech jobs, and companies can have their pick. They don't really need to be adversing or using extra channels to reach applicants, because they are already being flooded.

This also translates to job board revenues:

Railsdev is down around 85+% from peak, and Remoteok is down 70%ish (owner actually recently publicly asked how he can monetize their newsletter list with 1m subscribers, because he's seen company paid job posts go down 90% from peak)

Model that currently works best, is RemoteRocketship and EchoJobs - with the brutal market conditions, applicants are trying to find and get access to all the jobs they can, and are very much willing to pay for that access.

Other model that's doing well is the the job board + services - but again, that's not from job posts, but from support/CV/coaching/mentoring/courses.

# So, what does all of this mean for DataAnalyst.com / BusinessAnalyst.com??

It's really not clear to me how to tackle the monetization question in the current job market environment - because it's either offer extra services (but that takes time), serve ads (would want it to be delicate), or charge applicants (not something I'm keen on, they already have enough struggles).

Personally, I haven't figured out a way out of this just yet, but I have decided to listen to some great suggestions from all you kind people on Reddit, to start offering an exclusive partnership with a sponsor, that wouldn't be a detriment to on site experience.

I'm thinking one highlighted sponsor per month, on the whole site + newsletter - this could command a much higher fee, and would expand potential clients, from only employers, to education providers, analytics tools etc looking to target analysts.

The added benefit is the network of both DataAnalyst.com AND BusinessAnalyst.com, where for the time being I can offer same BusinessAnalyst placement as part of the package.

With that in mind, I've downloaded a dump of all companies/orgs paying for Google Ads, over the last 12 months.

Particularly targeting same keywords that I can offer them direct audience to, through the site. (i.e Data Analyst / Data Analytics + courses, certificate, tools, bootcamps etc - I'm not going for all the longtails for now, just the key subset)

Just over the last 5 months, that makes around 90 organisations (ranging from educational institutes, startups offering data analytics tools, to bootcamps and career tools providers) who target some of these specific keywords, and have actively spend on getting those ads up in search results.

That's the next job for me, to do an active outreach and see where it makes the most sense to go from here.

# Day in a life of a Data Analyst, with Christine &amp; C. G. Lambert

Another two interviews from our series has been published earlier this week. In these interviews, we aim to share stories and experiences about the route to becoming a data analyst, keeping up with the skillset, recommendations to aspiring data analysts and much more.

Firstly, thank you Christine, and Chris for your time, and sharing your experience, your journey, thoughts and advice with our readers, about growing one's career in the data analytics space.

***Speaking with Christine, who's the former director of Data at Vimeo, founder of the Analytics Accelerator***

Christine has been working in analytics since 2015, starting out in consulting, then working as a data analyst, data scientist, bootcamp instructor, and eventually becoming a data director at Vimeo. Last year she started her own bootcamp and mentorship program.

She shares what she loves the most about the data space:

*""There is so much room for creativity and curiosity in data analytics. Once you reach the layer of analytics beyond reporting and dashboard building, the job itself is the art and science of asking “why”.""*

And we also touched on the current state of the data analyst job market, with her thoughts and advice on how to stand out:

*""As soon as you have foundational technical skills, you need to apply these technical skills to real business problems as much as possible - not focus on getting to higher levels of difficulty on Leetcode.*

*With how competitive the market is right now, my advice is to think creatively about how you can create opportunities for yourself to apply these skills, instead of blindly applying to jobs that are saturated with other data analysts.*

*This includes using your personal and secondary network to do volunteer analytics work, or freelance analytics work - for example, even helping an Etsy shop owner understand her store trends and customers in Excel - to gain experience in which you use real data to help real people.*

*This will improve your resume, give you experience to talk about in interviews, and equip you with experience that is relevant to the actual job much more than racking up points on Kaggle.""*

And yes, we're also talking about the **(positive) impact of AI on the data analyst role**.

***Speaking with C. G. Lambert, who's the author of the book Adventures in Analytics: A Guide to Getting Ahead in Your Analytics Career.***

Chris walks us through his career journey - from starting in the banking sector, moving onto a developer role, and then finding his footing in the data analytics space. He quickly rose through the ranks, from a business analyst role, into more senior and leadership data manager positions, eventually starting up his own portfolio of companies.

He shares why learning where the Analytics role fits into the business is really important, as it will help you establish just how you are going to show that you are driving business value and justify your salary, your bonus and any promotion opportunities:

*""It is easy to focus on technical excellence. To do the courses. To collect trainings. Showing these certificates on your CV can be seen as progress to being a good Analyst. And to a certain extent that is necessary. You need to be able to use the tools. But if I can leave readers with one piece of advice it would be this: focus on actual business impact.*

*Learn the business. Sit with your stakeholders. Speak their language. Find out their pain points. And learn about the dollar impact of any of the pieces of work that you’ve done. And put those in the CV.*

*That shows people that you have a strong focus on how your work is used and how it improves the business.""*

It's a fascinating interview, where we also touch on the Question of the Year: Wondering if AI/Chat GPT is a threat to data analysts?

*Make sure you read both interviews on the blog, they are absolutely worth it.*

As I've mentioned before, I launched [BusinessAnalyst.com](http://BusinessAnalyst.com) - where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infrastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (after-all, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa).

Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any consistent revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck.

After the very slow start, the site is continuing its organic growth (albeit at a glacial pace).

I've naturally progressed with the content on the site, recently also adding a comprehensive business analyst salary guide.

While I'm spending a lot less time on the site than I would like to, I'm still reasonably happy with the growth I'm seeing.

I understand that the demand for data analyst roles, and data analyst as a career path has skyrocketed in recent years, making the job market extremely competitive and brutal.

Both Data Analyst and Business Analyst roles share a lot of similarities. So if you are looking for role that gives you exposure to data, going the Business Analyst route could also provide an opportunity to gain experience, and improve your data analytics skillset, albeit it would be a smaller part of your role. It's something that you can build on in the future, and use as a stepping stone in your pursuit toward a data analyst career.

# Things in the pipeline

* New data analyst jobs, added daily
* Figuring out what to do with the newsletter
* Monthly US data analyst market insights
* Improving the overall site experience (this one is a never ending activity)
* Continuing to bring you Data Analysts across their experience levels, to share tips, tricks and their thoughts

# 3 ways you could help

1. Looking for a new challenge? Check out the website - I'm adding new jobs daily
2. Looking to hire a data analyst to your team? Do you know anyone looking to hire? Shoot me a message on Reddit (or [alex@dataanalyst.com](mailto:alex@dataanalyst.com)) and I'll upgrade your first listing for free.
3. Looking to advertise? Now you can. Drop me an email and I can share the media kit.

***Call to action***: As you know, alongside the job board, the other focus is to bring interviews with data professionals across the experience levels to share their journey, tips and advice.

Overall, we've published 14 interviews, that I believe bring different point of views, stories of growth and sharing unique paths that each individual took to navigate their careers.

There's an absolute ton to learn from these:

* how to land data role internally within an organisation
* the power of showcasing and reframing your experience outside the direct data analytics field, and
* how moving into more leadership roles requires more than just being a data wiz

I'm currently looking for data analysts open to share their career journey.

These interviews have are read by tens of thousands of people who visit the site.

It's a great way to share your experience, help others, but also showcase your profile and promote yourself as someone who's actively driving their data career forward.

So if you're up for an email based interview, please just drop me anote, write couple of words about yourself and we'll organise something.

I would love to get you featured and share your story directly in the newsletter, with almost 4,600 of our readers!

10,How I dropped Meta Ads CPA from $94 to just .74 cents each,juststart,tomarv99,106,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1hq1mqn/how_i_dropped_meta_ads_cpa_from_94_to_just_74/,"I've been working with a SaaS platform that allows brands to send push notifications without a dedicated App. Their problem was they hired a marketing agency to run their ads instead of a performance marketer like myself. This resulted in a Cost per Acquisition of $94 which obviously isn't sustainable at all. Even though they raised $100M from investors like Beyonce, Post Malone and Shawn Menendez, they were reluctant to spend a ton of money on paid ads after the poor results with their ad agency.

A lot of Startups make the mistake of trusting their limited ad budgets to Marketing Agencies who are just in it for their 10 to 13%. As I looked through their ad settings I noticed a few big mistakes that I'll outline below. After fixing these mistakes, I was able to drop their CPA down to just .74 cents using the same conversion goal of website registrations tracked with the same Facebook pixel.

**Agency Mistakes**

**Trusting Facebooks Algo** \- When you leave it up to Meta to target your ads, you're CPA is going to start out very high and only go down after they have generated enough conversion data to drop it. When it does drop, its usually only 40% to 50% lower than where they started. This still leaves you paying way more for conversions than you should be.

**US Based Audience Targeting** \- The companies App can be used anywhere in the world so targeting US based accounts only will drastically raise your CPM (cost per 1,000 Impressions). The Ads the Agency created had a CPM of $149.

**No Interest Targeting** \- The Agency didn't use any interest targeting whatsoever. They just let Facebook figure it out

**No Custom Audience Development** \- The Agency didn't build any custom audiences from past converted customers or Google Search Audiences

**Image Based Creative** \- The agency didn't deploy any video ads for creative, just static ads that were vague and had no value proposition or compelling call to actions

**How I fixed the Campaign**

**Audience Targeting** \- The first thing I did was create a custom audience using Google Search Audience Feeds. I built an audience of people searching Google for ""Twillio"" and ""SMS Platforms"" and related keywords. We built an audience of about 150k Google Search users who had searched these types of keywords over the last 60 days to get as wide an audience as possible.

**Look-a-Like Audiences** \- I then built a ""Look-a-Like"" audience from this list and expanded the targeting to ""Worldwide"". The high intent targeting of the list allowed Meta to find similar accounts to our massive consumer data set. The ability to target a worldwide audience allowed us to drop our CMP all the way down to just .45 cents.

**Keyword/Interest based targeting** \- I used additional keyword targeting in Meta to help refine their algorithm to find additional users beyond our look-a-like audience. I also turned off Audience Network by selecting our own placements.

**Creative Development** \- For the creative, we used Captions to generate UGC videos that had the dual effect of allowing us to build retargeting campaigns based off video watch engagement.

**Front Loading Ad Spend** \- The other huge mistake people make in running ads on Meta is they don't make it out of the Learning phase of their ad spend. Spending $20 to $50 a day on ads is pointless from a conversion standpoint. You need to feed their algorithm conversion data and the only way to do that is to generate as many conversions as possible in as little time possible. Take 70% of your (2 week) ad budget and try to spend it as fast as you can after you start to see some positive results.

**Pixel Tracking Conversion Goals** \- You should also track conversions with a Pixel. Pixel conversion data is how Meta tracks conversions and is necessary for them to refine your audience with that conversion data. This will allow them to refine your audience even further and lower your CPA.

**Ad Campaign Set Up** \- I don't test more than one Ad Set at a time. I don't want ad sets competing against each other and I don't like testing more than 2-3 pieces of creative at a time within the same ad set. Most of the time, I test one Ad Set and one piece of creative at a time.

**Creative Optimization** \- The videos I generate with Captions have always outperformed Static content. If you're a die hard for static content, you can mix video creative with a static text over a dark gradient on your video. This has always dropped my CTR though. When I just run video ads, I've gotten my CTR as high as 9.8%

**Other Random Advice**

The conversion goal you chose has a huge impact on CPM and conversions. For instance, when you run traffic campaigns and land them on your landing page, your CPM will drop, but so will your landing page conversions. If you run the same ads with the conversion goal of ""Website Conversions"" tracked with a pixel, you'll drive traffic to the same landing page at a higher CPM but it will result in more signups at a lower cost. It's because the traffic they send has a higher percentage of signing up for other peoples offers than the lower converting traffic they send for traffic conversion goals.

When targeting ""Worldwide Audiences"" select ""English Speaking Accounts"" if you don't have multi-language translation support for your site. Even if you do, I still recommend running ads in English as your creative will be in English and you don't want to pay for ads that reach people who won't understand them.

If you have any questions about anything here, feel free to ask me anything. If you want to me audit your ads, feel free to reach out and I'd be happy to take a look and see how you could optimize them further."
10,"[Case Study] Automated AI SEO Content Site $0 to $3,674/m in 14 Months (Ads &amp; AMZ Affiliate) - $108K SOLD [AMA]",juststart,jamesackerman1234,87,164,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1cr0915/case_study_automated_ai_seo_content_site_0_to/,"Hello *(long detailed case study AMA* ask me anything, *with precise numbers, costing, processes and growth shared)*

* Overview of results (shared above)
* Month on month growth (shared above)
* Site summary (shared above)
* What's the main idea (explained in detail)
* How to do it?
* Researching niche
* Devising a content plan (article topics with main and secondary keywords, categories, subcategories and more)
* Reverse engineering competitors for an article structure that ranks
* Creating prompts that the script would run to create posts in bulk
* Bulk uploading the articles on WordPress
* Submitting and Indexing
* Building Backlinks
* Conversion rate optimisation
* Costing (very important)

**MAIN IDEA**

The idea is to:

* Find a niche with enough search volume and easy to beat competition
* Find content topics that can be answered using a similar article structure
* Example of similar structure article topics: What does ""sun"" mean in ""tarot"", What does ""emperor"" mean in ""tarot""
* In the above example, the queries have the same format: What does X mean in Y (use Ahrefs)
* Benefit: This helps us craft an article structure that can be replicated over thousands of articles
* Then, devise the article structure by reverse engineering the competitors
* Article structure will consist of different sections
* Construct AI prompts for each section to produce content
* Use Open AI and scripts to generate content for each section. Here, you will take input from the excel sheet that consists of the these keywords and related keywords
* Generate CSV that has all the responses
* Use WP ALL IMPORT to publish on WordPress Site

**HOW TO DO IT?**

Executing this reliant on three main variables. If you get these three right, the odds of success for such a project get higher.

* Content Plan
* Content production
* Backlinks

**1. Content Plan**

This is like a blueprint for the whole project. One of the redditors commented on my previous case studies and summarised it perfectly. He said, it's like a map to a treasure while you're sailing on the ship. If this blueprint is right and you follow the directions (execute), you will get the treasure. Otherwise, you will waste your time, resources and skills chasing something you'll never get. After years of efforts your ship will sink. This is very well put. I would like to thank him for this.

Important elements of content plan are:

* Niche selection: The criteria is:
   * Enough total search volume
   * Beatable competition
   * Display ads allow that niche
   * Enough affiliate programs
   * Enough small sites to ensure that you can still make money at a small scale
   * Enough big sites to ensure that you can make money at a big scale as well (this applies only when you wish to keep the project for long term and not sell when it's still small i.e. making less than $10,000 a month)
* Identifying queries with similar article structure (tarot example shared in the main idea section)
* Extracting queries in CSV
* Manually clustering the similar ones together. Example: ""what does SUN mean in tarot"" and ""what do you mean by SUN in tarot"" are essentially the same
* Finalising the articles based on above clustering and removing irrelevant ones
* Categorising into categories/subcategories
* Finalising pages (affiliates disclaimer, privacy policy, about us, contact, homepage content)

**2. Content Production**

* Reverse engineering competitors: analysing how the top ranking competitors are answering those queries in the form of articles
* Analysing the structure: What's their intro like, what's the first section then the next and next
* Compile this info to construct an article structure that covers everything and can be implemented to all the article topics (this is why we chose the topics that could be answered with the same article structure and are not too different)
* Include semantically relevant entities (engineer prompt accordingly)
* Ensure relevance to the main and subcategory and other articles within the same categories/subcategories

**3. Backlinks**

Here's a quick tip: Reach out to prospects and clearly ask if they offer a sponsored post. It makes things much easier and saves time.

Here's the criteria for the backlinks:

* Niche relevant or general sites
* DR greater than 20 (Ahrefs)
* Search traffic greater than 500 (Ahrefs)
* Content based
* Dofollow
* Indexed
* Anchor text that is relevant
* Permanent

**Generating Prompts and Scripting for Bulk Content Production**

The prompt engineering is highly dependent on what the competitors are doing. You have to analyse things like tone, structure, flow of sentences, paragraphs and general outline of the article. Devise prompts for each section and compare it with the competitors to get something as close BUT BETTER than that. Remember that in order to rank, you can be different in a way that it's better than the competitors. However, do NOT be too different. Otherwise, you won't rank.

As far as the script is concerned, it would be hard to explain it here. But, imagine...

* Excel sheet
* Column 1: Main keywords
* Column 2: Secondary keywords
* Column 3: Section 1 of article e.g. intro (generated based on a unique prompt to this that takes input from column 1 and 2)
* Column 4:  Section 2 of article e.g. first heading (generated based on a unique prompt to this that takes input from column 1 and 2)
* So and so forth to finish all sections of the article

This excel sheet is connected with OpenAI's API and the formula is added to each cell, it interacts with the API and sends request to produce the content using prompt coded into that formula and input taken from column 1 and 2.

Result: A CSV that consists of thousands of rows, each representing one article. Each row consisting of multiple columns. Each column representing a section of that article.

**Bulk Content Publishing on WordPress**

Using the CSV in the above step, you can use WP All import (WordPress plugin) to bulk publish the posts.

It would be redundant to explain the process here as you can easily check out a simple explainer YouTube video on this.

**Submitting and Indexing**

Use Google Developers API and RankMath to index the generated posts. Again, a simple Google search can return a guide that can help you do this. Writing this here is inefficient.

**Conversion Rate Optimisation**

The conversion rate optimisation of this project was done somewhere in around 12th month onwards. The RPM in previous recent months was around $10. But, with this CRO it increased to $17.

We did the following:

* Ads and affiliate offers in the sidebar
* Call to action for relevant affiliate offers in the form of a beautiful table right after the intro section

**Costing**

*Expenses*

* Content: Almost 1,500,000 words
* Content cost: $7500 (includes API tokens, researching comp., devising structure, prompts, publishing, everything etc.)
* Backlinks that we built and paid for: 75
* Average cost per backlink: $110
* Total cost for backlinks: $8,250
* Other admin: $1000
* Total: $7,500 + $8,250 + $1000 = $16,750

*Return*

* Earnings (affiliate and display): $9,728.69
* Sold: $108,000 (private sale)
* Total: $117,728.69

*Net*

* Net: $117,728.69 - $16,750 = $100,978.69
* ROI: 602%
* Duration: 14 months

**Way Forward and Analysis**

The fundamental shift in our approach was necessary. Producing content for brands and affiliate sites got super expensive and unable to rank with human writers. It killed a lot of big SEO projects in the industry.

The pivot enabled us to produce content faster, cheaper and in a more scalable way with higher quality.

With this approach, the goal is to scale the portfolio even further and hopefully publish more case studies of exits.

If you have any feedback/questions - feel free to let me know. This is an AMA. I would be happy to answer.

I’ve tested a ton of AI assistants and productivity apps. These are the ones I now use almost every day. They've helped me save a lot of time and hopefully they'll help you too:

1.  ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini

I use Chatgpt for writing, brainstorming, summarizing articles, rewriting emails. Claude for project planning and the very occassional coding. Neither are perfect, but nails my use case as a founder. I also use Claude desktop + MCP for all reporting, I've got it plugged into postgres, elasticsearch and notion. Gemini is surprisingly good at creating text based content, i use it to write blogs, tweets and linkedin.

My marketing agency doesn't do much visual content generation so my use cases aren’t creative specific (no image or video generation), but i heard good things about VEO.

2.  Grok

This beats Perplexity and Google IMO. It’s like search + research assistant. Gives clean answers + links. I use it for quick research or when I need sources to back up stuff for my agency. Especially good if you want to source Twitter.

3.  AI Meeting notetakers

My biggest problem with notetakers is no one actually looks at the notes after the call AND i still need to have an EA to organize the notes and send me a summary. I switched to Rumi earlier this year, their USP for me is to get information out into the hands of decision makers after the meeting.. which translates into me getting cliffnotes on what happened across sales and devs every morning automatically. Much good for my sanity.

4.  Raycast

I’ve got macros for my macros and I’ve got AI extended through all my apps. I ask it to summarize notes on all the DMs i’ve received over Slack, caffeinate my mac when I run local report and while I'm away at lunch, ask it to pull/summarize linear tickets I’ve received for the day, calendar meetings booked for rest of the week. It’s super powerful.

5.  n8n

I’m obsessed with workflows and agents. I’ve “outsourced” a bunch of tasks to it that I’d normally had to hire an assistant for. It’s also doing “vibe marketing” for me by repurposing content such as podcast episodes, mixing it with on the go opinions I type up on twitter and repurpose them into newsletters, cold out reach emails, linkedin post and even tiktok videos.

6. Cursor

Background agent now integrates with Slack. I’ve not fully given it a spin yet but so far we’ve added it to internal alerts channel where we dump stack traces. if we can just point cursor at stack traces and it’ll just fix the code.. that’s going to be insane.

9,I keep missing deadlines — it’s the 5th client now and I feel like I’m ruining everything,freelance,Main_Software_6689,113,142,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1lf5yyo/i_keep_missing_deadlines_its_the_5th_client_now/,"I'm a freelance video editor and I’ve been trying to make this work full-time, but I keep messing things up — and I’m not sure how to break the cycle.

This is now the 5th client where I missed a deadline. Most of them started as small projects (like $100–$200), but the work always expands — feedback turns into full rewrites, or I procrastinate too long, then rush, feel overwhelmed, and eventually miss the deadline entirely.

Latest case: I delivered, then got feedback that completely changed the project. I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.

I hate this pattern. It feels like I’m burning bridges one by one, and every time I tell myself ""next time I’ll be better,"" but then… same thing.

I don’t think I’m lazy. When I do work, I can focus for hours and I really care about the quality. But it’s like the pressure builds up, and instead of acting, I freeze. Or waste time on YouTube, telling myself I’ll start soon — until it’s too late.

Has anyone been through this? How do you break out of it?
I don’t want to keep sabotaging the few chances I get.
Any systems? Habits? Mindset shifts? I’m open to anything."

the one that delivers massive value, guarantees every success metric the client is solving for, and enabled me to hire specialized experts for each stage of the project.

Headed into the budget meeting, my instinct for the video project was $1,500... but the number I asked for on the call was $25,000... that would allow me to deliver the Holy Shit Package.

They went for it. I've quoted accordingly since.

9,We All Should Stop Min-Maxing Our Lives,productivity,ExtraMap1098,172,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1lt6077/we_all_should_stop_minmaxing_our_lives/,"This is a thought that has been floating in my head for quite a while, but I think we, as a society, should strive to stop min-maxing and incorporate more whimsy in our lives.

Why do we need to optimize everything? Why do we need to eliminate every distractions? Why can't we just live life as it is, flaws and all?

I min-maxed my entire life. I pride myself in my productivity and my achievements. I have very little social media presence. And it only left me wondering, is this all what life has to offer? Being a productivity machine and making money? Where is the fulfilment in that?

I can't enjoy the small things, because my brain keeps thinking about the future and what to optimize next. I can't enjoy the present because I am fixated on my goals. For others this is what you strive for, but let me tell you -- this sucks. This is not living. This is just existing.

I am always reminded of what Sam Altman said, ""Adjusted for the subjective increase in how time passes, life is half over by 23 or 24."" This is very true. Min-maxing life makes time passes faster. You are esentially also wasting time, just in a more societally acceptable way.

Sorry for the messy post. It is past midnight and I just want to put this thought out there. I strongly believe that one should not strive to be the most productive they could be. Don't try to optimize everything. Your life is more worthwhile than that.

I also recognize that this comes from a very privileged viewpoint. I do live a comfortable lifestyle that allows for a margin of error. Others may not. This is obviously not a clear-cut issue, but a conversation about this is gravely needed. "
9,The scaling bottleneck hiding in every startup. I WILL NOT PROMOTE,startups,findur20,111,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1lt8ch8/the_scaling_bottleneck_hiding_in_every_startup_i/,"Did a deep dive with 2 startups recently. All stuck between $200K-800K revenue for 6+ months. All had different products, markets, business models and they all had the similar problem.

None of them could make decisions without their founder. Sales rep needs pricing approval? Wait for founder. Customer wants a refund? Founder decides. New hire needs software access? Founder handles it. Marketing wants to try a new channel? Founder's call. The entire company stopped moving whenever the founder was in meetings, traveling, or just trying to focus on strategy. 

Most founders think this makes them helpful and accessible. They pride themselves on being involved in everything, actually, they've turned themselves into the biggest bottleneck in their own company. Every decision flows through one person, which means the company can only move as fast as that person can process interruptions. No wonder scaling feels impossible when you're the human equivalent of a traffic jam.

Create a decision-making delegation framework. List the 30 most common decisions in your business, document how to make them, set spending limits, and give specific people authority to decide without asking. Sales manager can approve discounts up to 20%. Customer success can refund purchases under $1000. Operations can buy software under $500 monthly. Marketing can test new channels under $2000 budget. You can't build a company that only works when you're there."
9,How Our GPT Went From 0 -&gt; 300 Conversations in 55 Days - i will not promote,startups,TheOneirophage,2,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1lq1c9o/how_our_gpt_went_from_0_300_conversations_in_55/,"This is the log of how I and my co-founders got our GPT up to 300 conversations with users in just under 2 months.

May 1st I started a new company with my co-founders Mark Herberholz.and Patrick Allen. Mark has launched 7 products to 10m users + 100m ARR and has extensive experience customizing AIs, while Patrick has been a Director of Development for the last 5 years and built adtech systems that serve 500k screens. The growth role fell to me.

The only problem is that my background is primarily in game design and business development. Biz dev is adjacent to marketing, in that they both have strategic, networking, and communications components, but the specific skills and tactics aren’t the same. I wasn’t quite starting from 0, I’d written or helped write most of the ads at the game studio I’d run, but I knew my lack of experience in this role would be one of the biggest risks to our company.

When we kicked off we had one asset: Mark had already built a GPT that validated new business ideas. Back in February, a friend had asked him to evaluate a game studio startup, and Mark spent a weekend encapsulating his knowledge as a product leader into a customized ChatGPT on OpenAI.  That meant we could hit the ground running by setting up a landing page with a waitlist and offering folks try GPT for free.

There were only four things we could measure as KPIs:

1. Number of conversations held in the GPT
2. Rating of the customized GPT
3. Number of visits to our landing page
4. Number of clicks to try the GPT from our landing page

Day 1: Conversations: 40, Rating 4.8.

We went from 10 -&gt; 40 conversations on the GPT when Mark shared our tool to his professional network of around 1300 people on LinkedIn.

Day 15: Conversations: 60, Rating 4.8.

We finally got our landing page up, and created our KPI tracking spreadsheet.  I started making weekly #BuildInPublic vlogs on YouTube around this date.

Day 22: Conversations: 100, Rating 4.8.

I experimented with posting on BlueSky (good engagement, small community), Twitter (bad engagement, huge community), LinkedIn (medium engagement, medium community), and Reddit (awesome engagement, large community).  Mostly I found out that vanilla posting wasn’t going to grow us as fast as we wanted. My best posts were getting hundreds of impressions, and most were getting tens.

Day 38: Conversations: 200, Rating 4.9

Making the YouTube videos was a good weekly anchor. I got into a cadence of making videos Sunday, and then dropping them Monday.  But it wasn’t perfect, they took a lot of time scripting and editing, and I was still a little nervous making them.  They were getting around 40-60 views, but not driving much traffic.  It seemed like they would help long term but not short term.  I tried using AI tools to cut them into shorts, but YouTube doesn’t work that way.  Your shorts need to be designed as shorts to keep attention, and they were all flops.

Mark and I agreed we needed to focus a LOT more on channels that drove views. I needed to drop things that weren’t getting traffic. From our website analytics it looked like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Reddit were our main sources of traffic. We also thought Facebook was just my friends who were curious about what I was doing, but not likely customers. We dropped that too.

Day 55: Conversations 300, Rating 4.6

I spent a lot of time looking for success stories.  Who had built audiences of 10,000 users fastest?  What were they doing?

I found playbooks for growth on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Reddit. I found automation tools for content creation, direct messages, locating relevant posts and communicators, and graphic support for banners, posts, and carousels.

Here are the tactics that have worked best for me so far:

1. Reply-marketing I. Find someone with a big following relevant to my business on LinkedIn or Twitter. Ideally put alerts on their posts so I can get to them first. Write something thoughtful and relevant, and/or name drop my product. This is often good for thousands of impressions, and slowly builds my own following as people notice that I have good insight and follow me.
2. Reply-marketing II. Notice when anyone talks about a problem my product solves Reply to them in the thread (more visibility than a DM, and helps the OP with engagement) with what my product is and how it could help them.  Give them a link (if appropriate), and ask them to let me know if there’s any way it doesn’t help so I can make it better.  (Sets lower expectations, and helps get useful user feedback later.)
3. DMs. In some places (notably Reddit) or contexts where it’s not appropriate to share a link or even to mention my product.  In those cases I use the same strategy as Reply-marketing II to send them a DM instead. I’ve gotten nothing but positive responses, because I’m ONLY messaging people who are already talking about having the specific problem my product solves.

Day 56: Conversations 300, Rating 4.6

We had our biggest day in terms of traffic to our website with 60 new visitors.  It had been hovering around 10 most days, without some kind of high impression content going out and getting attention. It took me a while to realize what drove it, but it was our post on LinkedIn that announced we had hit 300 conversations. Nothing makes people curious like success. Plus the post was mostly a screenshot of our dashboard showing our product name, description, and # of users on the ChatGPT store. It’s a good image for a LI scroll-stopper.

I’ve been getting more disciplined about reply-marketing and DMs, and getting better tools to do it faster. So far this week we’re around 15 new visitors a day, up 50% vs previous weeks. I’m going to invest more time/effort in this way and see if that keeps things growing.

For this entire experiment, the number of visitors to our site and the number of conversations on the GPT remained about the same despite the 12% CTR.  We theorize that some users are having multiple conversations, and others are finding the product through the GPT search function within OpenAI.

Now you’re all caught up. Have questions? Throw them down. Want links to things I’m using?  Happy to share. Have advice? Please, give it.

9,South African healthcare system just killed my friend.,digitalnomad,747WakeTurbulance,745,133,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1lu14u3/south_african_healthcare_system_just_killed_my/,"My best friend was on a photo safari in South Africa last month when he suffered a heart attack. He was deep in the bush and urgently needed to be medevacked to a hospital by helicopter.

He could easily afford any care required. But the emergency services told him they did not take credit cards — the money had to be wired to their bank account before they would dispatch a helicopter.

At 4 a.m. local time, his wife was desperately calling family back home, asking them to be at the bank when it opened at 9 a.m. to arrange the transfer. By 10 a.m., the tens of thousands of dollars demanded had been wired.

And then they waited. It took another three hours for the helicopter to be dispatched and to finally reach him. When he was flown to the cardiology facility, the hospital refused to evaluate or treat him until a second wire transfer was completed. His wife had the family rush back to the bank to send more money.

Only then, hours later, did they bring in a heart specialist. After running tests, they confirmed he needed a stent. He was prepped and taken to surgery. About an hour later, a man who called himself the doctor came out and said the surgery had been successful, but that my friend had died afterward and that ""there was nothing they could have done.""

There was no compassion, no grief counseling, just cold information and a number to a funeral home that she could work with to get the body back - for an additional wire.

She was completely alone for two days until her son was able to reach her. It then took two full weeks for the body to be released and transported back to the U.S.

My friend was a good man. A pillar of our community. He volunteered his construction services for people in need. He lived honestly and generously. He did not deserve to be treated this way. He could have paid for everything upfront without hesitation. But the South African health care system refused to act until they had their money in the bank. Those 18 lost hours in getting the money transferred cost him his life. He was only 60 years old.

Yes, he had travel insurance. But that meant nothing. Travel insurance reimburses you — it doesn’t pay upfront. In South Africa, if you’re a foreigner, you must have cash in their bank before they will do anything.

The funeral was yesterday. And I will never forgive them for what they did."

I love reading stories of people's journeys here so here is my part.  woke up to a $200 charge from the Dreamhost for another year of renewal of their services. So Today marks one year of my blogging journey. Here are some Stats from Analytics;

Total Users - 36k

Biggest day was 96 users

Google search console Stats;

Total Impressions 528k

Total clicks 32.8k 

Average CTR 6.2%

Average position 9.2

My website and Why I started this: 

I watched all seasons of Shark Tank US and after each episode, I'd go to the Shark Tank recap website and check how those companies are doing now. I tried searching for the Indian version of the show but nothing like that existed so I decided to create one. 

Here is my [website ](https://www.sharktankindiaclub.com/)

The HIGHS:

TBF all I did was to get the website up and start writing content and made sure that my score on SEO was in the 90s and that worked (briefly at least lol). the new season of Shark Tank India started in January and I started pumping content the same night the episodes aired. In the morning it was validated and on Google and I was getting visitors. 

I MADE IT, I remember the feeling in February of this year when I was getting anywhere from 500 to 900 visitors a day on the website. Mind you I was also putting in about 20-30 hours of work a week alongside of my full-time job but it was so worth it. 

The LOWs;

Google update hit in March, I also got super sick and was in the hospital so I stopped working on the site first two weeks mainly because I was on medication and sleeping most of the time. I checked the website a week later and my traffic was down to under 100 people a day and it was going down very fast. it stabilized at around 50 visitors a day mid-April.

Also, some work stuff happened and my car died a week later at the worst imaginable place but that's another story. In short, March was the worst month I had in probably the last 6 years lol 

Last 6 months:

I decided to just keep my head down and keep working and completing the project. It felt like a chore when I was pumping content but I slowed down and started writing things on my own timeline. Summer was here and I had less time to work on it anyway so I decided imma slow down and get back at it during Fall/Winter. I do really enjoy just checking out companies, and searching up people to see if I can find any information so I do consider this a hobby now. 

My new articles are taking a while to show up on Google search and rankings are not great. 

Future: 

I'm 48 articles away from completing the project until the new season so the plan is to write those in the next couple of months. I would also go over the companies before the new season airs and update the articles accordingly so tons of work ahead in the next 3 months. The good news is I can get back into the routine. I enjoyed the summer but I usually do not like going out in winter so I would have more time to work on it and I'm looking forward to it. 

Final Goal:

While financially I don't think this would be successful, It will help me professionally in the future. I'm very likely to keep this up and maintain it to see how it goes(or until I find a new thing to work on). As I said it's a hobby at this point. 

Thank you for reading an I hope Y'all are having a good day:)

9,I am not letting HCU win and take my career away!,juststart,InternetImperia,104,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1f9tszp/i_am_not_letting_hcu_win_and_take_my_career_away/,"Hey folks, 

Never posted here before, but found so much inspiration and ideas during the time this community thrived. 

I felt nostalgic the other day of a community that supported each other.   
  
I want to try to be a voice of positivity. I've been in SEO for nearly 10 years, and the last 5 were spent enjoying the sweet nectar of niche sites. Those are definitely my best years and I am trying my hardest to not have to switch careers. 

Since HCU, I think the biggest part of JustStart has given up on building their websites or starting new ones, but I want to let you know that there's still hope for this type of business.   
  
I think majority of people who left this business have made the biggest mistake - it's like with any business - you double down during the dips when most people bail. I see more opportunity now than ever. 

I know I am one of the rare folks who managed to recover from HCU (not 100%, but enough that this still remains to be my top income source). 

**Proof of recovery:** [https://ibb.co/vdryNnM](https://ibb.co/vdryNnM) 

**What did I do to recover:**   
-Disavowed hundreds of toxic and low quality backlinks.   
-Trimmed nearly 100 pages that weren't ranking (built these due to ""topical authority"").   
-Improved internal linking for each page (every page now has a minimum of 7 internal links).   
-Added a community component (which is active and ranking for some keywords too).   
-Added a 'services' component (it just generates leads which I end up selling, I am not actually fulfilling the services).   
-Homepage looks like a legitimate business and not a blog.  
-Added merch - it now looks like an eCommerce store, although I am selling only a few items here and there.   
-Added 30-50 high quality backlinks - these are not bought ones, but hard earned ones. Spent 300+ hours on them, but now I have top websites linking to me. 

Even though this is a rare recovery, I've started a ton more websites since the beginning of this year. 3 are now in the range of 5k and 10k in organic traffic. Not a lot, but they are climbing slow. 

Others are... well not doing that well, but on a lot of these I've just tested a lot of stuff to find a perfect formula of how much AI content I can use etc. 

And the perfect amount is fairly low, but still enough to boost my production quite a bit. 

Happy to answer any questions you may have and help out.   
  
Don't ask me to share my website, please, I am just not willing to do that. "
9,[UPDATE 1] $0 to $10k MRR In Dec 2024,juststart,guilds_randomly,25,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1btu33g/update_1_0_to_10k_mrr_in_dec_2024/,"Ok, so here’s my first update. 


Right off the bat, our goal to create a site and monetize a directory site via lead gen/rank and rent and advertising hit a snag.


Things got super crazy with my agency, and then Google dropped this core algo update (biggest I’ve seen in 10 years) so we spent a lot of time monitoring that pretty closely.


So, I had less time than I thought I was going to for this project and just paid a friend do the site for me. We’ve got the page templates done and the URL structure mapped out and logo created.


It’s built on wordpress using Mai Theme and we’re going to be creating mass pages. 


Some of the tools we’re going to be using for content creation are:


Cora

Page Optimizer Pro

SEO CoPilot

Zimmwriter

Claude3

Team GPT


For keyword research:


SEMRush

Keyword Chef


For content clustering we’ll be using Keyword Insights


For competitive intelligence we’ll be using SEMRush, Ahrefs, and Majestic.


For monitoring and reporting we’ll be using Google Search Console, Google Analytics, and probably Agency Analytics too since we already use it in the agency.


For video creation, either Lumen5, Pictory, InVideo, or Wave.video


Additionally, we’ll be using Rank Week to monitor and automate page indexing, and Colinkri and whatever indexing tool is working at the moment for our backlinks.


Some of the wordpress plugins we’re using (aside from the ones in Mai Builder) are


SolidSecurity (formerly iThemes)

WP Rocket

RSS Includes Pages

LinkWhisper

Header Footer Code Manager

SEO Press PRO

WP All Import PRO


Our IFTTT ring will be finished in a day or two, and we’ll build tiered linking behind those properties. We’re also going to be setting up a YouTube channel and then sending out a press release.


By the end of the week we should have, at the very least, 60 pages of content


Homepage

About Us

Privacy Policy

Contact Us

10 Service Pages

1 Page For Each State


Like I mentioned above, we’re going to be doing a lot of mass pages written with AI for this.


I know, I know, this update hit a lot of mass page and pSEO sites, and Google hates AI content. The thing is though, we do mass pages for our clients and they’ve all come out of this update just fine. The trick is, we have a multi step optimization process for these, human editing, and hand write schema to put on our pages, and make sure they have internal links. So not completely programmatic, but we can still crank out tons of pages.


I’ve also been scraping the information of companies in our targeted niche to upload via WP All Import Pro to create the directory listings.


Link building has already started and will of course be a continuous process. We’ll be using niche edits, guest posts, PRs, etc, and then backing them up with tiered linking.


We did a bit of shuffling and reorganizing at the agency this past month, instituted more automations and hired new team members so I should have more time to work on this consistently in April.

Indexing was pretty slow in March because of the algo update, but once the roll backs in April are done indexing should be back to normal. Once the pages we publish get indexed we’ll start shooting links over to them."
9,1 Year Progress Report,juststart,maynevent,82,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1bj6en4/1_year_progress_report/,"Last progress report: https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/18dgd71/month_8_progress_report/

This is going to be my last update, seeing as how I am passed the 'Just Start' phase. I did it! I started and have just continued chuggin' along. I have graduated from having zero experience to having just the faintest clue as to what I am doing. Progress! Maybe within 5 year's time, I'll graduate into the realm of mediocrity. One can hope :)

**tldr; Have 71 published articles/pages, seemed to hit a ceiling with traffic - then decline, making pretty good money, IMO**

**Backstory and Learnings:**

Since my last update, I have only managed to publish/create 12 articles/pages. I took a little time off before the holidays to relax, and then during the holidays, I got sick and am still dealing with that. But, I sort of got back in the groove the past few weeks as I have been creating new content for my site.

I am using one of my affiliate partner's API to bring in product details &amp; images (hundreds upon hundreds) and dynamically creating affiliate links on evergreen pages I am creating. The best way I can describe what I am trying to achieve is essentially a Pinterest board focused only on this single topic. I had to develop that functionality on my own so I leveraged ChatGPT again to help me code the PHP. I'd say I am about 50% of the way complete with the whole process.

One thing I noticed when creating these pages was that once they were finished, I manually submitted them to Google for indexing. Once submitted, they would be indexed within literally 60s. Not sure why that is, but I'll take it. Another thing I have done within the past month was (finally) set up my site using CloudFlare's CDN.

I have to say, I am really impressed. My site was by no means slow, but with CloudFlare, it loads near instantly on both my desktop and phone. I am very happy with the results of using their CDN. It still takes a bit of time for the ads JavaScript to load, but that all happens after the page is fully rendered and is usable for the user.

**Traffic:**

Last update, I was talking about a 300 click wall I seemed to stuck on. I never did really break through that wall. There was a small window where after Christmas where I would occasionally eclipse 400+ clicks per day from Google, but that fell to around 350 clicks per day until the last third of January. Then I was back to the 300 click wall again.

Now, with the March update currently in progress, I am down to what feels like a 250-275 click wall. It seems like odd days are high 200s and even days are mid, to even low, 200s. The weird thing is that my GA4 traffic is not as chaotic as GSC's traffic. I have a post that trends on YouTube and FaceBook nearly every single day, so that is definitely helping out.

According to GA4, I am getting anywhere from 600-775 page views per day. I suppose we are all just riding this out to see how April looks once this update is over. I'll be 100% straight, I am lowkey just waiting for the day for Google to take it all away. Obviously, I hope I am wrong, but that is my gut feeling. But, until then, I'll be carrying on as normal.

**Videos:**

I have not made any new videos. It is something I know I will need to continue doing, especially with the rocky seas at Google. I have a few ideas and things I want to shoot, but I just really dislike the editing and voice over work. All that being said, I will say, the lone long-form video I have uploaded has a thumbs up/down ratio of 197/5. So at least people are getting value of it and enjoying it. 

**Numbers**:

Despite my traffic being down, or at least not growing at the moment, I feel like I am making good money from my site. For context, I joined the Impact site on 10/31. I joined the Share-a-Sale site on 10/25. I joined Monumetric for ads on 12/10. I joined Amazon in April 2023.

But... what? I genuinely don't understand!

  
What do you do in excel to:

\- Take into account vacation days, weekends and days off to make a task longer or shorter in duration depending on when it's scheduled and who its assigned to

\- Manage dependencies, if one task grows to take longer than expected, are you manually moving all following tasks too?

\- Get an overview of people: who is at capacity, who still has room, easily move tasks in time and resource assignment to solve the issue?

\- Given a list of tasks and their estimated effort and priority, build a fitting schedule (maybe even based on skills of people and needs of the task). Do you just... manually color cells until the puzzle somehow fits?

\- Deal with non-fulltime tasks. Some people can work maybe 10% on a task, so how can you keep an overview of when that person can handle additional 90% of other tasks and keep track of how long those will take now?

\- Get reminders when tasks need to be done, are overdue or otherwise need an update?

\- Keep track of what people are working on right now

\- Deal with newly incoming, higher prio tasks that need to be shoved into the planning. Imagine 300 rows of tasks, now all need to be manually recolored to indicate their new schedule??



Surely, I'm missing something. Maybe lots of formula's or templates people use. I sincerely hope no one does it this way truly manually, or could enlighten me as to why it is superior. It currently feels like, yes you can do everything like this in excel or on paper, but man you'll be recoloring boxes the whole day, having time for nothing else!"

I'm a data engineer/analyst by trade but new to running ops.

I’m good with coding/automations/APIs but my business partner is not, and it’s just us two.

## What I want:
- Automate 80% of data entry (especially contacts, deals, touchpoints)
- Coach spends &lt;20 mins a few times per week just reconciling, not entering data
- Simple data model: contacts → accounts → deals → touchpoints (emails, Zoom meetings)
- Clean UI for non-technical coach to review pipeline and make edits
- Under $100/month
- When I need serious analytics, I'll build a pipeline to BigQuery - CRM is just the operational interface

## What I don't want:
- Hours of manual data entry every week
- Writing custom CSV upload/download scripts
- Complex API integrations just to get basic automations working
- Paying someone offshore to babysit data quality issues
- A CRM that requires a training course to use effectively
- ""Flexible"" platforms that need 20 hours of setup and break constantly

## Automation examples:
- Zoom meeting ends → auto-log touchpoint with duration/participants to deal
- Stripe payment → auto-link to deal and mark won
- Calendar booking → create deal/contact
- Email exchanges → log as touchpoints

## What I've tried (10+ hours each):

### HubSpot ❌
- **Pros:** Good integrations, touchpoint tracking
- **Cons:** Useful features locked behind $100+/month. UI is clunky for daily use. Over-engineered for our simple needs.

### Pipedrive ⚠️
- **Pros:** Clean UI, $25/month, good API
- **Cons:** Stripe integration sucks. Activity tracking is basic. Data model doesn't fit services well - lots of manual workarounds needed.

### Klaviyo ❌
- **Pros:** Amazing automations, seamless Stripe integration, great event tracking
- **Cons:** Built for e-commerce. No deal pipeline. Can't track $10K coaching sales cycles.

### Monday.com ❌
- **Pros:** Flexible
- **Cons:** Too flexible - requires tons of custom setup that breaks easily. Overkill for simple contact→deal→touchpoint flow.

Maybe I'm using CRMs wrong, but they all claim to automate data entry yet seem to require tons of manual work or custom coding. I don't want to spend hours writing CSV upload scripts or complex API integrations.

**Am I missing something obvious, or do I just need to build a simple frontend on our existing data?**"

9,My neighbor added 10 truckloads of dirt to their yard and now our backyard floods every time it rains.,legaladvice,WCScores,609,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1lt7tri/my_neighbor_added_10_truckloads_of_dirt_to_their/,"Location: Minnesota

For context. The house is rented out and we get along with the tenants. I have never met the owner, nor have I had any dialogue with him. My wife and I have lived here for 5 years. 3 years ago, we added a fence for our dogs, and I attempted to contact the owner via text to show him pictures of our planned fencing materials and ensure him we were marking property lines, etc. 
There has always been flooding in our backyard. About a year ago, a small bobcat type of truck and 10 massive truckloads of dirt mixed with stones and sticks was dropped off at our neighbors house. Not only did the dirt encroach into our property, but it also covered the bottom boards of our fence. After this winter, we had a ridiculous amount of flooding from the snow melting. 
On our side, we decided to add in a rain garden. We dug 24 inches deep, added sand, pea gravel, dirt, plenty of water absorbing plants and decorative rock. I also changed the direction of the gutters on my garage so it flows away from the rain garden completely. Unfortunately we are still getting, at some points, up to 6-10 inches of standing water in our backyard, which also flows into our garage. 
We reached out to the city of Minneapolis, and they came out to look at the property. We found out that indeed, yes, the owner did not follow city rules and regulations, and had been fined. After a month, the owner has still not paid the fine, and the city informed us that it will be placed on the owners property taxes. We took from this that the owner, who owns several units around our neighborhood, couldn’t care less about the fine or our complaints to the city. 
Suffice to say, our garage, our rain garden and our backyard have been SAVAGED by standing water. Our sump pump has been running non stop. We finally snapped and reached out for legal help, and have hired a lawyer. We have dozens of pictures, several with a measuring tape in the water, along with clear runoff paths from their yard to ours and the standing water in our garage. 
The lawyer wants a retainer of $3000, and we are suing the owner for damages to the garage, which we will need assessed by a civil engineer, and either a permanent fix to their backyard following the city’s rules, or removal of all the dirt. 

To be clear, we want a permanent fix, we aren’t trying to screw the guy over. We tried all other avenues, but still find ourselves anxious every time it rains. 
Are we doing the right thing? Is the retainer too much, or a good deal? Is hiring a civil engineer not needed? We want to trust the lawyer, but we have no clue what we are doing. Please help, any information would be amazing! I’ll answer any other follow up questions as soon as I can. TIA!!!

TLDR; lawyer wants $3,000 retainer to sue owner of the house (our neighbor) for damages to our property after assessment by a civil engineer. What do we need to know or be prepared for?!"
9,Neighbors cameras pointing directly at my 18yo girlfriend’s bedroom window and house.,legaladvice,Apyqr,249,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ltaywn/neighbors_cameras_pointing_directly_at_my_18yo/,"Location: Massachusetts

A couple days ago the neighbors put up 3 cameras all on one side of their house that just so happens to point directly toward the side of my girlfriend’s house. Their intentions for the cameras are obviously not good because they have about a sliver of property on that side and then it goes straight to our property and then a big sidewall blocking the view of anything else other than the windows. 

I’m wondering if there is any legal action that could be taken for them to take the cameras down. I don’t want to get involved with the police if they can’t end up doing something. I googled what would constitute them needing to remove the cameras but the specifics were pretty fuzzy which is why i ask this here. The wall the cameras are pointed to has three windows, two of which are bedrooms. They conveniently set these cameras up just a few days after my girlfriend turned 18, but she still has friends over that sometimes change in her room and it’s making everyone very uncomfortable. 

Here is a picture taken from my girlfriend’s bedroom window, the black squares in each window is a camera.

adsimpler (dot com)

vs

adsimple (dot co)

\---

I'm a marketing guy who designs, publishes, and analyzes thousands of ads every year. I've been doing it for 5 years now, and I've tried almost every SaaS available to help with that process.

However, every single one of them had cut corners that didn't make sense, and I'm now tired of it.

In the past year, I started to create my own tools and automations to accelerate my workflow, and I noticed a significant improvement. So, I thought, why not put all that into a simple web app?

The first solution it would offer is a swipe file of hundreds of handpicked winning ad creatives, with ready-to-go templates. This would allow small and large businesses to reuse proven winning ads from big brands and adapt them to their brand using their favorite design tool (Figma or Canva).

Many more features would be added after launching, all of which would make advertising easier (and faster).

Since this business would ""live"" on the web, I thought that I would search for names by looking at the domain availability first.

That's where the decision comes in:

I managed to get adsimple (dot co), but then realized adsimpler (dot com) was available.

The goal is to make advertising simple, so I guess they both make sense. With that being said, English isn't my first language, so I would love to get others' feedback on how they see (and read) it.

8,marketing update: 9 tactics that helped us get more clients and 5 that didn't,Solopreneur,goudgirls,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Solopreneur/comments/1ltrlq4/marketing_update_9_tactics_that_helped_us_get/,"About a year ago, my boss suggested that we concentrate our B2B marketing efforts on LinkedIn.

We achieved some solid results that have made both LinkedIn our obvious choice to get clients compared to the old-fashioned blogs/email newsletters.

Here's what worked and what didn't for us. I also want to hear what has worked and what hasn't for you guys.

# 1. Building CEO's profile instead of the brand's, WORKS

I noticed that many company pages on LinkedIn with tens of thousands of followers get only a few likes on their posts. At the same time, some ordinary guy from Mississippi with only a thousand followers gets ten times higher engagement rate.

This makes sense: social media is about people, not brands. So from day one, I decided to focus on growing the CEO/founder's profile instead of the company's. This was the right choice, within a very short time, we saw dozens of likes and thousands of views on his updates.

# 2. Turning our sales offer into a no brainer, WORKS LIKE HELL

At u/offshorewolf, we used to pitch our services like everyone else: “We offer virtual assistants, here's what they do, let’s hop on a call.” But in crowded markets, clarity kills confusion and confusion kills conversions.

So we did one thing that changed everything: we productized our offer into a dead-simple pitch.

**“Hire a full-time offshore employee for $99/week.”**

That’s it. No fluff, no 10-page brochures. Just one irresistible offer that practically sells itself.

By framing the service as a product with a fixed outcome and price, we removed the biggest friction in B2B sales: decision fatigue. People didn’t have to *think*, they just *booked a call*.

This move alone cut our sales cycle in half and added consistent weekly revenue without chasing leads.

If you're in B2B and struggling to convert traffic into clients, try turning your service into a flat-rate product with one-line clarity. It worked for us, *massively*.

# 3. Growing your network through professional groups, WORKS

A year ago, the CEO had a network that was pretty random and outdated. So under his account, I joined a few groups of professionals and started sending out invitations to connect.

Every day, I would go through the list of the group's members and add 10-20 new contacts. This was bothersome, but necessary at the beginning. Soon, LinkedIn and Facebook started suggesting relevant contacts by themselves, and I could opt out of this practice.

# 4. Sending out personal invites, WORKS! (kind of)

LinkedIn encourages its users to send personal notes with invitations to connect. I tried doing that, but soon found this practice too time-consuming. As a founder of 200-million fast-growing brand, the CEO already saw a pretty impressive response rate. I suppose many people added him to their network hoping to land a job one day.

What I found more practical in the end was sending a personal message to the most promising contacts AFTER they have agreed to connect. This way I could be sure that our efforts weren't in vain. People we reached out personally tended to become more engaged. I also suspect that when it comes to your feed, LinkedIn and Facebook prioritize updates from contacts you talked to.

# 5. Keeping the account authentic, WORKS

I believe in authenticity: it is crucial on social media. So from the get-go, we decided not to write anything FOR the CEO. He is pretty active on other platforms where he writes in his native language.

We pick his best content, adapt it to the global audience, translate in English and publish. I can't prove it, but I'm sure this approach contributed greatly to the increase of engagement on his LinkedIn and Facebook accounts. People see that his stuff is real.

# 6. Using the CEO account to promote other accounts, WORKS

The problem with this approach is that I can't manage my boss. If he is swamped or just doesn't feel like writing, we have zero content, and zero reach. Luckily, we can still use his ""likes.""

Today, LinkedIn and Facebook are unique platforms, like Facebook in its early years. When somebody in your network likes a post, you see this post in your feed even if you aren't connected with its author.

So we started producing content for our top managers and saw almost the same engagement as with the CEO's own posts because we could reach the entire CEO's network through his ""likes"" on their posts!

# 7. Publishing video content, DOESN'T WORK

I read million times that video content is killing it on social media and every brand should incorporate videos in its content strategy. We tried various types of video posts but rarely managed to achieve satisfying results.

With some posts our reach was higher than the average but still, it couldn't justify the effort (making even home-made-style videos is much more time-consuming than writings posts).

# 8. Leveraging slideshows, WORKS (like hell)

We found the best performing type of content almost by accident. As many companies do, we make lots of slideshows, and some of them are pretty decent, with tons of data, graphs, quotes, and nice images. Once, we posted one of such slideshow as PDF, and its reach **skyrocketed!**

It wasn't actually an accident, every time we posted a slideshow the results were much better than our average reach. We even started creating slideshows specifically for LinkedIn and Facebook, with bigger fonts so users could read the presentation right in the feed, without downloading it or making it full-screen.

# 9. Adding links to the slideshows, DOESN'T WORK

I tried to push the slideshow thing even further and started adding links to our presentations. My thinking was that somebody do prefer to download and see them as PDFs, in this case, links would be clickable. Also, I made shortened urls, so they were fairly easy to be typed in.

Nobody used these urls in reality.

# 10. Driving traffic to a webpage, DOESN'T WORK

Every day I see people who just post links on LinkedIn and Facebook and hope that it would drive traffic to their websites. I doubt it works. Any social network punishes those users who try to lure people out of the platform. Posts with links will never perform nearly as well as posts without them.

I tried different ways of adding links, as a shortlink, natively, in comments... It didn't make any difference and I couldn't turn LinkedIn or Facebook into a decent source of traffic for our own webpages.

On top of how algorithms work, I do think that people simply don't want to click on anything in general, they WANT to stay on the platform.

# 11. Publishing content as LinkedIn articles, DOESN'T WORK

LinkedIn limits the size of text you can publish as a general update. Everything that exceeds the limit of 1300 characters should be posted as an ""article.""

I expected the network to promote this type of content (since you put so much effort into writing a long-form post). In reality articles tended to have as bad a reach/engagement as posts with external links. So we stopped publishing any content in the form of articles.

It's better to keep updates under the 1300 character limit. When it's not possible, adding links makes more sense, at least you'll drive some traffic to your website. Yes, I saw articles with lots of likes/comments but couldn't figure out how some people managed to achieve such results.

# 12. Growing your network through your network, WORKS

When you secure a certain level of reach, you can start expanding your network ""organically"", through your existing network. Every day I go through the likes and comments on our updates and send invitations to the people who are:

from the CEO's 2nd/3rd circle and

fit our target audience.

Since they just engaged with our content, the chances that they'll respond to an invite from the CEO are pretty high. Every day, I also review new connections, pick the most promising person (CEOs/founders/consultants) and go through their network to send new invites. LinkedIn even allows you to filter contacts so, for example, you can see people from a certain country (which is quite handy).

# 13. Leveraging hashtags, DOESN'T WORK (atleast for us)

Now and then, I see posts on LinkedIn overstuffed with hashtags and can't wrap my head around why people do that. So many hashtags decrease readability and also look like a desperate cry for attention. And most importantly, they simply don't make that much difference.

I checked all the relevant hashtags in our field and they have only a few hundred followers, sometimes no more than 100 or 200. I still add one or two hashtags to a post occasionally hoping that at some point they might start working.

For now, LinkedIn and Facebook aren't Instagram when it comes to hashtags.

# 14. Creating branded hashtags, WORKS (or at least makes sense)

What makes more sense today is to create a few branded hashtags that will allow your followers to see related updates. For example, we've been working on a venture in China, and I add a special hashtag to every post covering this topic.

Thanks for reading.

As of now, the CEO has around 2,500 followers. You might say the number is not that impressive, but I prefer to keep the circle small and engaged. Every follower who sees your update and doesn't engage with it reduces its chances to reach a wider audience. Becoming an account with tens of thousands of connections and a few likes on updates would be sad.

We're in B2B, and here the quality of your contacts matters as much as the quantity. So among these 2,5000 followers, there are lots of CEOs/founders. And now our organic reach on LinkedIn and Facebook varies from 5,000 to 20,000 views a week. We also receive 25–100 likes on every post. There are lots of people on LinkedIn and Facebook who post constantly but have much more modest numbers.

We also had a few posts with tens of thousands views, but never managed to rank as the most trending posts. This is the area I want to investigate. The question is how to pull this off staying true to ourselves and to avoid producing that cheesy content I usually see trending."
8,50k Followers on Instagram in 2 years - Update,Solopreneur,Slow_Trash_3204,5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Solopreneur/comments/1lt6c2z/50k_followers_on_instagram_in_2_years_update/,"**Hey guys**,

Few months ago I was struggling to get more business.

I read hundreds of blogs and watched hundreds of youtube videos and tried to use their strategy but failed.

When someone did respond, they'd be like: How does this help?

After tweaking what gurus taught me, I made my own content strategy that gets me business on demand.

I recently joined back this community and I see dozens of posts and comments here having issues scaling/marketing.

So I hope this helps a couple of you get more business.

I invested a lot of time and effort into Instagram content marketing, and with consistent posting, l've been able to grow our following by 50x in the last 20 months (700 to 35k), and while growing this following, we got hundreds of leads and now we are insanely profitable.

As of today, approximately 70% of our monthly revenue comes from Instagram.

I have now fully automated my instagram content marketing by hiring virtual assistants. I regret not hiring VAs early, I now have 4 VAs and the quality of work they provide for the price is just mind blowing.

If you are struggling, this guide can give you some insights.

**Pros**: Can be done for SO investment if you do it by yourself, can bring thousands of leads, appointments, sales and revenue and puts you on active founder mode.

**Cons**: Requires you to be very consistent and need to put in some time investment.

**Hiring VAs:** Hiring a VA can be tricky, they can either be the best asset or a huge liability. I've tried Fiverr, Upwork, agencies and Offshore Wolf, I currently have 4 VAs with [u/offshorewolf](/user/offshorewolf/) as they provide full time assistants for just $99/Week, these VAs are very hard working and the quality of the work is unmatchable.

I'll start with the Instagram algorithm to begin with and then I'll get to posting tips.

You need to know these things before you post:

**Instagram Algorithm**

Like every single platform on the web, Instagram wants to show it's visitors the highest quality content in the visitor's niche inside their platform. Also, these platforms want to keep the visitors inside their platform. Also, these platforms want to keep the visitors inside their platform for as long as possible.

From my 20 month analysis, I noticed **4 content stages** :

**#1 The first 100 minutes of your content**

**Stage 1:** Every single time you make a post, Instagram's algorithm scores your content, their goal is to determine if your content is a low or a high quality post.

**Stage 2:** If the algorithm detects your content as a high quality post, it appears in your follower's feed for a short period of time. Meanwhile, different algorithms observe how your followed are reacting to your content.

**Stage 3:** If your followers liked, commented, shared and massively engaged in your content, Instagram now takes your content to the next level.

**Stage 4:** At this pre-viral stage, again the algorithms review your content to see if there's anything against their TOS, it will check why your post is performing exceptionally well compared to other content, and checks whether there's something spammy.

If there's no any red flags in your content, eg, Spam, the algorithm keeps showing your post to your look-alike audience for the next 24-48 hours (this is what we observed) and after the 48 hour period, the engagement drops by 99%. (You can also join Instagram engagement communities and pods to increase your engagement)

**#2: Posting at the right time is very very very very important**

As you probably see by now, more engagement in first phase = more chance your content explodes. So, it's important to post content when your current audience is most likely to engage.

Even if you have a world-class winning content, if you post while ghosts are having lunch, the chances of your post performing well is slim to none.

In this age, tricking the algorithm while adding massive value to the platform will always be a recipe that'll help your content to explode.

According to a report posted by a popular social media management platform:

\*The best time to post on Instagram is 7:45 AM, 10:45 AM, 12:45 PM and 5:45 PM in your local time. \*The best days for B2B companies to post on Instagram are Wednesday followed by Tuesday. \*The best days for B2C companies to post on Instagram are Monday and Wednesday.

These numbers are backed by data from millions of accounts, but every audience and every market is different. so If it's not working for you, stop, A/B test and double down on what works.

**#3 Don't ever include a link in your post.**

What happens if you add a foreign link to your post? Visitors click on it and switch platform. Instagram hates this, every content platform hates it. Be it reddit, facebook, linkedin or instagram.

They will penalize you for adding links. How will they penalize?

They will show it to less people = Less engagement = Less chance of your post going viral

But there's a way to add links, its by adding the link in the comment 2-5 mins after your initial post which tricks the algorithm.

Okay, now the content tips:

**#1. Always write in a conversational rhythm and a human tone.**

It's 2025, anyone can GPT a prompt and create content, but still we can easily know if it's written by a human or a GPT, if your content looks like it's made using Al, the chances of it going viral is slim to none.

Also, people on Instagram are pretty informal and are not wearing serious faces like Linkedin, they are loose and like to read in a conversational tone.

Understand the consonance between long and short sentences, and write like you're writing a friend.

**#2 Try to use simple words as much as possible**

Big words make no sense in 2025. Gone are the days of 'guru' words like blueprint, secret sauce, Inner circle, Insider, Mastery and Roadmap.

There's dozens more I'd love to add, you know it.

Avoid them and use simple words as much as possible.

Guru words will annoy your readers and makes your post look fishy.

So be simple and write in a clear tone, our brain is designed to preserve energy for future use.

As a result, it choses the easier option.

So, Never **utilize** when you can **use** or **Purchase** when you can **buy** or **Initiate** when you can **start**.

Simple words win every single time.

Plus, there's a good chance 5-10% of your audience is non-native english speaker. So be simple if you want to get more engagement.

**#3 Use spaces as much as possible.**

Long posts are scary, boring and drifts away eyes of your viewers. No one wants to read something that's long, boring and time consuming. People on Instagram are skimming content to pass their time. If your post looks like an essay, they'll scroll past without a second thought. Keep it short, punchy, and to the point. Use simple words, break up text, and get straight to the value. The faster they get it, the more likely they'll engage. **If your post looks like this no one will read it, you get the point**.

**#4 Start your post with a hook**

On Instagram, the very first picture is your headline. It's the first thing your audience sees, if it looks like a 5 year old's work, your audience will scroll down in 2 seconds.

So your opening image is very important, it should trigger the reader and make them swipe and read more.

**#5 Do not use emojis everywhere**

That's just another sign of 'guru syndrome.'

Only gurus use emojis everywhere Because they want to sell you They want to pitch you They want you to buy their $1499 course

It's 2025, it simply doesn't work.

Only use when it's absolutely iMportant.

**#6 Add related hashtags in comments and tag people.**

When you add hashtags, you tell the algorithm that the #hashtag is relevant to that topic and when you tag people, their followers become the lookalike audience, the platform will show to their followers when your post goes viral.

**#7 Use every trick to make people comment**

It's different for everyone but if your audience engages in your post and makes a comment, the algorithm knows it's a value post.

We generated 700 signups and got hundreds of new business with this simple strategy.

Here's how it works:

You will create a lead magnet that your audience loves (ebook, guides, blog post etc.) that solves their problem.

And you'll launch it on Instagram. **Then, follow these steps**:

**Step 1**: Create a post and lock your lead magnet. (VSL works better)

**Step 2**: To unlock and get the post, they simply have to comment. 

**Step 3**: Scrape their comments using dataminer. 

**Step 4**: Send automated dms to commentators and ask for an email to send the ebook.

You'll be surprised how well this works.

 **#8 Get personal**

Instagram is a very personal platform, people share the dinners that their husbands took them to, they share their pets doing funny things, and post about their daily struggles and wins. If your content feels like a corporate ad, people will ignore it.

So be one of them and share what they want to see, what they want to hear and what they find value in.

**#9 Plant your seeds with every single content**

An average customer makes a purchase decision after seeing your product or service for at least 3 times. You need to warm up your customer with engaging content repeatedly which will nurture them to eventually make a purchase decision.

**# Be Authentic**

Whether that be in your bio, your website copy, or Instagram posts, it's easy to fake things in this age, so being authentic always wins.

The internet is a small place, and people talk. If potential clients sense even a hint of dishonesty, it can destroy your credibility and trust before you even get a chance to prove yourself.

That's it for today guys, let me know if you want a part 2, I can continue this in more detail."
8,"We switched from Twilio to Messente and here’s how the delivery rates, reporting, and dashboard compare after 100k messages",SaaS,JamieNorth,22,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1ltukys/we_switched_from_twilio_to_messente_and_heres_how/,"I manage messaging for a fintech app that sends thousands of transactional messages every day mostly OTPs, payment alerts, and account notifications. Like most teams, we started with Twilio. It worked well at first, but we started running into issues as we scaled.

Here’s a breakdown of what made us switch and how Messente has held up after 100,000+ messages.

# Why we moved away from Twilio

* Pricing started getting unpredictable once we scaled  
* Delivery rates dropped in some markets, especially in Asia  
* Reporting was too basic for our compliance needs  
* Support wasn’t responsive when we had urgent delivery issues  

# Why we tried Messente

Someone from a logistics company recommended it for international delivery. I hadn’t heard of them before, but the platform promised better delivery reliability, more transparent reporting, and support for both SMS and Viber fallback, which sounded useful for some of our markets.

# What we found

**Reporting**

Twilio’s reporting was fine for basic use cases, but Messente gave us full delivery logs, timestamps, and error codes we could actually act on.

**Dashboard**

Messente’s UI is way more focused. No bloat. Everything is where it should be.

**Support**

When we ran into questions during implementation, their team got back to us within a few hours. One time they even helped troubleshoot carrier filtering in real time.

**Global delivery**

This was the biggest difference. Delivery rates improved immediately in countries where we previously had trouble. We suspect it’s due to direct carrier routes, but either way, it worked.

**API**

Very straightforward. I’d say just as easy to implement as Twilio’s."
8,QEBIT – Quantum-inspired Entropic Binary Information Technology (Update Post),programming,Ambitious-Display576,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1lu0fgd/qebit_quantuminspired_entropic_binary_information/,"&gt;**Update:** This README and project represent a major update compared to the last Reddit post. It is intended for direct use in a future public GitHub repository, and is written to be clear and informative for both new and returning readers. It includes new features like self-healing, time-travel debugging, archive agents, advanced roles, and significant performance and robustness improvements. See the comparison section below for details.

# 🚀 Overview

QEBIT is a framework for **quantum-inspired, intelligent, adaptive swarm agents**. It combines classical bit performance with advanced swarm intelligence, memory, error correction, self-healing, and now also **time-travel debugging** and **collective memory**.

# ❓ What is a QEBIT?

A **QEBIT** (Quantum-inspired Entropic Binary Information Technology unit) is more than just a bit. It is an intelligent, quantum-inspired agent that acts as a protective and adaptive shell around a classical bit. Each QEBIT:

* **Encapsulates a classical bit** (0 or 1), but adds layers of intelligence and resilience.
* **Acts as an autonomous agent**: It can observe, analyze, and adapt its own state and behavior.
* **Provides error correction and self-healing**: QEBITs detect, correct, and learn from errors, both individually and as a swarm.
* **Enables advanced features**: Such as trust management, memory, time-travel debugging, and swarm intelligence.

Think of a QEBIT as a ""shielded bit""—a bit with its own agent, capable of reading, protecting, and enhancing itself and the data stream it belongs to.

&gt;**Note:** A QEBIT is not a physical quantum bit. It is a purely digital construct—essentially a 'bit on steroids'—that exists in software and provides advanced features and intelligence beyond classical bits.

&gt;**Personal Note:** This project is developed and maintained by a single person as a hobby project. All progress, design, and code are the result of individual experimentation and passion for quantum-inspired computing and swarm intelligence. There is no team or company behind QEBIT—just one enthusiast exploring new ideas step by step.

# 🧠 Key Features

* **Quantum-inspired QEBITs**: Probabilistic states, superposition, adaptive bias.
* **Persistent Memory**: Central, shared memories (`memories.json`), experience consolidation.
* **Adaptive Error Correction**: Learning from errors, dynamic correction strategies.
* **Swarm Intelligence**: Role assignment, trust management, collective learning.
* **Self-Healing**: Autonomous regeneration and integration of new QEBITs.
* **Archive Agents**: Dead QEBITs become memory fragments, knowledge is preserved.
* **Time-Travel Debugging**: Reconstruct past swarm states for error analysis.
* **Archivist Role**: Indexes patterns and knowledge from the swarm, supports swarm archaeology.
* **Dynamic Trust Restoration**: Archive agents can be reactivated if they possess critical knowledge.

# 🧪 Latest Benchmark &amp; Test Results

* **Error Resilience:** QEBITs achieved 0 errors after regeneration and voting, outperforming classical bits in error correction and robustness.
* **Self-Healing:** The swarm autonomously regenerated lost QEBITs, restored full functionality, and maintained data integrity without human intervention.
* **Time-Travel Debugging:** System state at any past timestamp can be reconstructed using archive agents, enabling root-cause analysis and audit trails.
* **Archive Agents:** Excluded QEBITs (archive agents) preserved rare error patterns and knowledge, which were successfully used for swarm archaeology and error recovery.
* **Swarm Stability:** Guardian monitoring confirmed stable operation with clear distinction between active and archive agents, even after multiple regeneration cycles.
* **Pattern Indexing:** The archivist role indexed all known error profiles and patterns, supporting advanced analytics and swarm archaeology.

**Example Log Highlights:**

* ""Errors after regeneration and voting: 0""
* ""Reconstructed state at error timestamp: ..."" (full QEBIT state snapshots)
* ""Archivar pattern index: {error\_profile: {...}}""
* ""Guardian: Swarm stable (Active: 11, Archive Agents: 1, no action needed)""

These results demonstrate the system's ability to self-heal, preserve and recover knowledge, and provide advanced debugging and analytics capabilities far beyond classical bit systems.

# Key Technical Achievements

* **Autonomous Operation**: System can run indefinitely without human intervention
* **Knowledge Preservation**: No data loss even after agent failures
* **Historical Analysis**: Complete audit trail and state reconstruction
* **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design supporting complex swarm behaviors

# 🏗️ Architecture

# Core Components

* **QEBIT**: Quantum-inspired binary unit with memory, error profile, trust, roles.
* **Intelligence Layer**: Memory consolidation, decision making, pattern recognition.
* **Network Activity**: Collaborative learning, bias synchronization, data sharing.
* **Guardian**: Monitors swarm state, triggers self-healing and regeneration.
* **Archive Agents**: Excluded QEBITs, serving as knowledge sources and for time-travel.
* **Archivist**: Collects, indexes, and analyzes patterns and error profiles in the swarm.

# Roles

* **COORDINATOR**: Decision making, trust management
* **ANALYST**: Entropy analysis, pattern recognition
* **CORRECTOR**: Error correction, adaptive learning
* **NETWORKER**: Swarm communication, voting
* **GUARDIAN**: Monitoring, swarm stability, self-healing
* **REGENERATOR/VALIDATOR/INTEGRATOR**: Autonomous QEBIT regeneration
* **ARCHIVE/ARCHIVIST**: Memory fragment, pattern indexing, swarm archaeology

* **REHABILITATOR**: Reactivates valuable archive agents

# 🕰️ Time-Travel Debugging

* Each QEBIT stores snapshots of its state with a timestamp.
* With `QEBIT.reconstruct_state(archiv_data, timestamp)`, the swarm state can be reconstructed for any point in time.
* Perfect for root-cause analysis, audit trails, and swarm archaeology.

# 📦 Example: Error Analysis &amp; Swarm Archaeology

    # An error occurs
    archiv_data = [a for a in swarm if a.role == QEBITRole.ARCHIVE]
    reconstructed = QEBIT.reconstruct_state(archiv_data, error_timestamp)
    # Archivist indexes patterns
    pattern_index = archivist.index_patterns()

# ⚡ Performance &amp; Benchmarks

* QEBITs are now much faster thanks to batch operations, caching, and lazy evaluation.
* Adaptive error correction and swarm intelligence ensure extremely low error rates—even after agent loss and regeneration.
* Archive agents prevent knowledge loss and enable recovery after total failure.

&gt;**Notice:** The persistent memory file (`memories.json`) can grow very large over time, especially in long-running or large-scale swarms. This is a known drawback of the current approach. However, using a JSON file for persistent memory is intentional at this stage: it allows for rapid prototyping, easy inspection, and fast testing/debugging of agent memory and learning processes. Future improvements may include memory compression, delta storage, or automated archiving of old sessions to keep the system scalable.

# 🧩 Use Cases

* Adaptive, resilient systems with collective memory
* Swarm-intelligent sensor and communication networks
* Real-time error analysis and recovery
* Research on emergent behavior and collective AI

# 📝 Changelog (Highlights)

* **Persistent Memory**: Central, shared memories for all QEBITs

8,QEBIT - Quantum-inspired Entropic Binary Information Technology (Update AGAIN),programming,Ambitious-Display576,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ls0ug2/qebit_quantuminspired_entropic_binary_information/,"# The Journey

This project started as a Python implementation with heavy mock Qiskit integration. After realizing the limitations of simulated quantum behavior, I completely rebuilt it from scratch with native Qiskit integration, following advice from Reddit user Determinant who emphasized the importance of real quantum integration over reinventing the wheel.

While it's still simulated quantum behavior (not running on actual quantum hardware), that's exactly the goal - to achieve quantum-inspired intelligence without needing expensive quantum hardware. It's ""real"" in the sense that it actually works for its intended purpose - creating intelligent, adaptive binary systems that can run on classical computers. The QEBITs can communicate, collaborate, and develop emergent intelligence through their network capabilities, even though they're slower than classical bits.

# What are QEBITs?

QEBITs are intelligent binary units that simulate quantum behavior while adding layers of intelligence:

* **Quantum-inspired**: Probabilistic states, superposition simulation
* **Intelligent**: Memory, learning, pattern recognition
* **Adaptive**: Behavior changes based on entropy and experience
* **Collaborative**: Network-based collective intelligence
* **Emergent**: Unexpected behaviors from interactions

# Performance Results

# Benchmark: 10 QEBITs vs 10 Classical Bits (1000 iterations each)

|Operation|Classical Bits|QEBITs (Optimized)|Improvement|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Measurement|0.059s|0.262s|1.77x faster than non-optimized|
|Bias Adjustment|0.003s|0.086s|4.28x faster than non-optimized|
|Combined Operations|0.101s|0.326s|2.83x faster than non-optimized|

**Overall**: QEBITs are **4.30x slower** than classical bits, but **2.39x faster** than non-optimized QEBITs.

# Intelligence Test Results

&gt;**⚠️ Notice**: The following intelligence test results are heavily simplified for this Reddit post. In the actual system, QEBITs demonstrate much more complex behaviors, including detailed context analysis, multi-step decision processes, and sophisticated pattern recognition.

# What This Shows

Even in this simplified test, you can see that QEBITs:

* **Learn from experience**: Each QEBIT has different collaboration/failure ratios
* **Develop preferences**: All show high collaboration confidence (0.84) and prefer collaboration
* **Maintain memory**: They remember their learning experiences and behavioral adaptations
* **Adapt behavior**: Their decisions are influenced by past experiences

This is intelligence that classical bits simply cannot achieve - they have no memory, no learning, and no ability to adapt their behavior based on experience.

# Why Slower But Still Valuable?

# Classical Bits

* ✅ Lightning fast
* ❌ No intelligence, memory, or learning
* ❌ No collaboration or adaptation

# QEBITs

* ⚠️ 4.30x slower
* ✅ **Intelligent decision-making**

# The Reddit Influence

Following advice from Reddit user Determinant, I:

* Rebuilt the entire system from scratch in Python
* Integrated real Qiskit instead of mock implementations
* Focused on actual quantum-inspired behavior
* Avoided reinventing quantum computing concepts

While true quantum entanglement isn't implemented yet, the system demonstrates that intelligent communication and collaboration can exist without it.

# Performance Analysis

# Why QEBITs Are Slower

1. **Complex State Management**: Probabilistic states, history, memory
2. **Intelligence Overhead**: Decision-making, learning, pattern recognition
3. **Network Operations**: Collaboration and data sharing
4. **Memory Management**: Session history and learning experiences

# Achievements

* **2.39x overall speedup** through optimizations
* **4.28x bias adjustment improvement** with lazy evaluation
* **2.83x combined operations improvement**
* **Maintained all intelligent capabilities** while improving speed

# Conclusion

QEBITs represent a paradigm shift from pure speed to intelligent, adaptive computing. While 4.30x slower than classical bits, they offer capabilities that classical computing cannot provide.

The 2.39x performance improvement shows that intelligent systems can be optimized while maintaining their core capabilities. For applications requiring intelligence, learning, and adaptation, the performance trade-off is well worth it.

**QEBITs demonstrate that the future of computing isn't just about speed - it's about creating systems that can think, learn, and evolve together.**

*Built from scratch in Python with real Qiskit integration, following Reddit community advice. No true entanglement yet, but intelligent collaboration and emergent behaviors are fully functional.*"
8,"[Discussion] The Latin word for ""left"" literally means ""evil"" - and this linguistic programming has been sabotaging human potential for centuries",GetMotivated,OhhNahNah,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1lu6is7/discussion_the_latin_word_for_left_literally/,"# The Latin word for ""left"" literally means ""evil"" - and this linguistic programming has been sabotaging human potential for centuries

**TL;DR: I discovered that most ""genetic limitations"" might actually be unoptimized bilateral brain development caused by centuries of cultural programming against the left side of our bodies. Simple experiments you can try yourself included.**

---

## The Mind-Blowing Etymology That Started Everything

So I'm down a research rabbit hole about bilateral brain integration when I discover this:

**Latin: ""Sinistra"" (left) → English: ""Sinister"" (evil/wrong)**  
**Latin: ""Dexter"" (right) → English: ""Dexterous"" (skillful/correct)**

Wait, WHAT? 

The words for left and right literally encode ""left = evil, right = good"" into our language. And it gets worse:

**""Ambidextrous"" literally means ""two right hands""** - even the word for bilateral skill assumes right-hand superiority!

This isn't just linguistic trivia. This is **systematic cultural programming** that's been suppressing half of human potential for centuries.

---

## The Personal Discovery That Changed Everything

Here's where it gets weird. I started noticing something about my walking:

**When I start walking with my RIGHT foot:** My left foot can't match the stride. Even when I consciously try to make them equal, my left foot feels clumsy and out of sync.

**When I start walking with my LEFT foot:** They instantly move in perfect tandem. Effortless bilateral coordination.

This blew my mind. **My right-brain (controlling left foot) is naturally good at bilateral integration. My left-brain (controlling right foot) sucks at it.**

So I started experimenting...

---

## The 6-Month Bilateral Integration Experiment

I spent months systematically developing my non-dominant side:

- **Switched my watch to opposite hand** (simple bilateral cue)
- **Started gym exercises with weak side first** (instead of dominant → tired weak side)
- **Practiced left-handed writing on graph paper** 
- **Used left-hand computer mouse** with foot pedals for navigation
- **Switched sleeping sides when I had pain**

**Results:**
- **Noticeably clearer thinking** and better pattern recognition
- **Improved right-handed golf swing** from learning left-handed 
- **Better right-handed penmanship** from left-handed practice
- **Reduced pain patterns** from bilateral movement variation
- **Enhanced problem-solving** through what felt like ""whole brain"" thinking

---

## The Science That Backs This Up

Turns out there's actual research supporting bilateral integration:

**Corpus Callosum Development:** The neural bridge connecting brain hemispheres literally grows thicker through bilateral coordination training. Musicians have measurably larger corpus callosi from using both hands.

**Mind-Muscle Connection Research:** Studies show 20-60% increased muscle activation when you consciously focus on specific muscles during exercise.

**Rate of Force Development:** Most people achieve only 40% of their potential muscle activation in the first 50ms of movement (range: 10-800%). This is trainable.

**Hemispheric Specialization:** Left brain = logical/systematic, Right brain = creative/spatial. Most people only optimize one side.

---

## Simple Experiments You Can Try Right Now

**The Watch Switch:** 
Wear your watch on the opposite wrist for a day. Notice how it feels different and affects your movement awareness.

**The Gym Flip:**
Next workout, start every exercise with your weak side first. Feel how much better attention and energy your weak side gets.

**The Writing Challenge:**
Try writing your name with your non-dominant hand. Now try some left-handed writing on graph paper. Notice if your dominant hand writing improves.

**The Gait Test:**
Pay attention to which foot you naturally start walking with. Try consciously starting with the opposite foot. Does one feel more coordinated?

**The Sleep Switch:**
If you always sleep on one side, try the opposite side for one night. (Especially if you have pain on your usual side.)

---

## The Bigger Picture: What If ""Genetics"" Is Actually Optimization?

Here's my controversial hypothesis: **What we call genetic limitations might often be unoptimized bilateral development.**

Think about it:
- **1940s-1990s:** Teachers literally forced left-handed kids to write right-handed because ""left = wrong""
- **Every tool is designed for right-hand dominance** (scissors, equipment, etc.)
- **All gym equipment has single anchor points** creating systematic bilateral dysfunction
- **Athletes get locked into asymmetrical patterns** (three-point stance, batting stance) for years

**We've created a civilization that systematically suppresses bilateral development, then wonder why people feel ""half-functional.""**

## The Athletic Connection

I played football (fullback) in college. Thousands of repetitions in the same three-point stance. Right side always loaded, left side always trailing.

**Years later, I realized:** Those ""phantom pain patterns"" and movement asymmetries weren't just aging - they were **pattern imprisonment** from athletic programming.

**The breakthrough:** Consciously practicing opposite-side athletic positions helped release patterns I didn't even know I was carrying.

---

## Why This Matters

If bilateral integration is trainable (which research suggests it is), then:

- **Cognitive limitations** might be hemispheric disconnection rather than fixed capacity
- **Movement dysfunction** might be pattern imprisonment rather than inevitable aging  
- **Athletic performance** could be enhanced through bilateral development rather than just dominant-side optimization
- **Creative blocks** might be solved through systematic bilateral brain integration

---

## The Cultural Programming Goes Deep

**Left-handed people know this instinctively.** They've been forced to develop bilateral adaptation their whole lives. They're walking examples of what systematic bilateral integration can achieve.

**Equipment examples:**
- Left-handed scissors don't exist in most stores
- Computer mice, tools, instruments - all designed for right-hand dominance
- Even **gym equipment** is systematically biased (try using a lat pulldown machine - notice how the knee pads slope to accommodate right-leg dominance, or any single anchored leg extension machine)

**We've built a world that forces adaptation on 10% of people while letting 90% operate in systematic bilateral dysfunction.**

---

## Try This For One Week

Pick ONE of these experiments:

1. **Switch your watch hand** and notice how it affects your movement awareness
2. **Start with weak side first** in any physical activity (gym, sports, daily tasks)
3. **Practice writing/drawing with non-dominant hand** for 10 minutes daily
4. **Consciously alternate which foot starts your walking** throughout the day
5. **Try sleeping on opposite side** if you have any pain or always sleep the same way

**Pay attention to:**
- Changes in coordination or comfort
- Any improvements in your dominant side performance
- Shifts in thinking clarity or problem-solving
- Different sensations or awareness in your body

---

## The ""Why Not?"" Philosophy

Here's the thing: **these experiments cost nothing and take minimal time**. Even if I'm completely wrong about the bigger theory, bilateral coordination training has documented benefits.

**But if I'm right?** We might be sitting on the biggest human optimization opportunity in history, hiding in plain sight because we've been linguistically programmed to ignore half our potential.

**Worst case:** You develop better coordination and cognitive flexibility.  
**Best case:** You unlock capabilities you didn't know you had.

Why not find out?

---

## Questions For Discussion

- Have you noticed bilateral asymmetries in your own movement or thinking?
- Does the linguistic programming angle (sinistra = sinister) change how you think about left/right bias?
- What happens when you try the simple experiments? 
- Are there other cultural assumptions about ""genetics"" that might actually be optimization opportunities?

**I'm genuinely curious about your experiences.** This could be completely wrong, partially right, or the tip of a much bigger iceberg. Let's find out together.

---

**Edit:** This is speculative thinking based on personal experimentation and pattern recognition, not medical advice. I'm just a guy who got really curious about why his left foot couldn't match his right foot's stride and fell down a fascinating rabbit hole.

**Edit 2:** For those asking about sources - look up ""corpus callosum neuroplasticity,"" ""bilateral coordination training,"" and ""hemispheric integration research."" The individual pieces are well-documented; I'm proposing they connect in ways we haven't fully explored."
8,LinkedIn / Apollo Scraper + Outreach Automation,automation,ChaseAI,27,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1lt6ish/linkedin_apollo_scraper_outreach_automation/,"This automation conducts the entire cold outreach pipeline from lead discovery to email campaign setup, all while creating custom outreach messaging for each individual lead.

Big picture, this workflow scrapes lead's information from Apollo via Apify, conducts research on the lead's company via Tavily, creates custom messaging for each lead by combining that scraped information with your personal value proposition, then uploads all the relevant information (messaging, lead info, emails) to [Instantly.ai](http://instantly.ai/) to conduct a full scale email campaign. The user simple fills out a form stating what sort of lead they are after (job title, location, company size, and keywords).

I've created multiple variations of this workflow in the past with direct LinkedIn scraping being conducted via Apify but I've found using Apollo to grab what is ultimately the same LinkedIn information tends to work out much better-- especially when it comes to finding valid emails.

Cost to run this isn't cheap but it also isn't prohibitively expensive. Individual costs are shown in the image but this can be scaled to thousands of emails without breaking the bank.

Instantly has a pretty robust email campaign system so you're all set when it comes to warming up accounts and having a one stop shop for monitoring the campaign progress.

Lastly, when it comes to areas of improvement, I would move away for Google Sheets in favor of something more flexible. You could also argue the integration of some sort of email validator would be nice but I've found Apollo to be pretty reliable on that front.

8,Spent 10 hours building this AI automation on a Saturday because... who needs weekends? (Day 5/50),automation,akhilpanja,47,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1lshkcq/spent_10_hours_building_this_ai_automation_on_a/,"Alright Reddit, hear me out.

It's Saturday night. Normal people are out having fun. Me? I just spent 10 hours straight debugging webhook connections and arguing with merge nodes because apparently, I hate myself.

**The Challenge:** 50 days, 50 AI automations. No breaks. No weekends. Just pure, caffeinated determination. 5th Day it is!

**Today's Build:** An AI Content Repurposing Machine that turns one piece of content into 6 platform-optimized versions. Because manually rewriting the same post for LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, newsletter, and blog is SO 2023.

**What it does:**

* You write once
* AI transforms it for each platform (with proper formatting, hashtags, everything)
* Saves to Google Sheets
* 3 hours of work → 47 seconds

**The Stack:**

* n8n (self-hosted because I'm cheap)
* DeepSeek API (way cheaper than GPT-4, almost as smart)
* Some questionable CSS animations that I'm oddly proud of
* My sanity (deprecated)

**Pain Points I Discovered:**

* Webhook URLs have a `-test` suffix that disappears in production (learned this at hour 7)
* Merge nodes in n8n are like that friend who says they'll help you move but never shows up
* The expression `{{ $json.content }}` vs `{{ $json.body.content }}` cost me 2 hours of my life

**Watch the demo video through my Google's Drive link** in the comments - Warning: Contains excessive celebration when it finally worked

**The UI:** Okay, I may have gone overboard with the dark theme and animations. But after staring at code for 10 hours, making things glow seemed like a good idea. Judge me.

**GitHub:** Get the JSON workflow in the comments - Feel free to roast my node structure

Real talk though - this actually saves me hours every week. I write these automation posts once and boom, ready for every platform.

**Tomorrow's preview:** Day 6 - Building an AI that... actually, I should probably sleep first and figure that out.

How's everyone else's weekend going? Anyone else building stuff instead of having a social life?

P.S. - If you're a client reading this, yes, I'm available for projects. My weekend rate is 2x because apparently, I don't know how to rest."

# Inbound vs Outbound lead generation - the only two ways to get clients and their differences:

Outbound (fast, but effort-heavy):

* **Upwork:** The fastest way to get paid. Clients are warm and ready, but the competition is crazy intense. Good for first wins.
* **Networking:** High conversion, low cost, but slower to scale.
* **Cold Email/Calls:** Scalable and free, but low conversion and slow to start.

Inbound (long-term, compounding) - this is where you can build a sustainable business:

* **YouTube / Twitter / Reddit / SEO**: Build trust, show your knowledge, and let clients come to you.

Because at some point, your content and efforts generate inbound traffic. 

**Where Clients Are (And How Warm They Are) - Total overview**

This table shows you the difference between platforms and the ease of sales.

|Channel|Speed|Cost|Warmth|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Upwork|Fast|💵 Costs|🔥🔥🔥|Great for early traction **(Low Pay)**|
|Reddit|Medium|Free|🔥🔥|Find real problems → pitch solution **(Medium Pay)**|
|LinkedIn|Slow|Free|🔥|Inbound + DMs if done right **(High Pay)**|
|Email/Cold Calls|Slow|Free|❄️|Works, but takes volume. **(High Pay)**|
|YouTube/Twitter|Slow|Free|🔥🔥|Long-term audience building **(Medium Pay)**|

**Freelancer vs Brand/Agency**

There's a big difference between these two. At some point, you’ll hit a ceiling as a solo expert.  
  
It's totally fine to just be the expert, but building a brand and or agency is where the scaling can happen. Businesses looking to spend $5k–$10k+ want to work with:

* Agencies with systems
* Teams they can trust
* Solutions, not “just a person with a tool”

I realized that **branding**, a website, and clear positioning helped me land bigger clients with less grind. Yet it takes time and trust to get there. 

If you’re just starting:

* Focus on solving business problems, not just offering “automations”
* Think long-term: inbound systems will save you years of grind in the future
* Brand yourself or build a lean agency to land bigger clients
* Consider which platform to use and have the right expectations

8,Siri Shortcuts to outsource my self control,workflow,Angrybunnyman,36,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/workflow/comments/9ix58c/siri_shortcuts_to_outsource_my_self_control/,"Technology is amazing. I can spend hours reading news about panda bears and kittens and sloths and dissolve into an endless stream of continuous scrolling. Great! Yes?

I mean, maybe. Like it’s not inherently bad but we are certainly encouraged to do less than good things with our time. And I have not been, historically, the best at keeping myself away from the less good things.

This is something I’ve been working on for myself for years and the advent of Workflow, and now Siri Shortcuts, I’ve been reimagining my relationship to my devices and, through that, the internet. iOS 12 has been marvelous for me.  

The deeper integration Shortcuts has compared to Workflow has allowed easier and more granular control over how I use my devices. This last weekend, I spent like 3 hours building app launches, templates trackers, and other stuff to help encourage better habits in myself.  

For example, I’ve locked social media apps, apps I classify as “distraction”, behind a Shortcut that both encourages me to choose a better thing - like reading - and sets a timer to break any continuous scrolling trances that these apps generate.  

I have to admit, I’m *really excited* at how this will help me do more productive things with my devices.

I’m trying to piece this out into a few essays because a write to think. If that or this is your bag, here’s a [link to a longer blog on it ](https://angrybunnyman.com/blog/siri-shortcuts-part1)

8,Need advice from agency founders,agency,ercngezgin,20,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/agency/comments/1l98567/need_advice_from_agency_founders/,"Hi everyone,

I want to share a bit about my background before I ask my questions.

I have a bachelor's degree in marketing, and while I was studying, I had the chance to work with several small paid media clients, both on a paid and unpaid basis. The thing is, I was treating every account as if it were a global brand. For example, I found myself developing complex remarketing structures with product-specific data layers for campaigns with just a $10/day budget, acting like I was managing a massive project.

As experienced agency founders might understand, I started getting more clients just through word-of-mouth. However, I began to feel like this industry is a hell of a lot of work, with tons of struggle and responsibility.

I've graduated now, and I'm earning more than I would at a typical full-time job, but I feel very lost. Other than three agency internships, I don't have formal agency experience, yet life has brought me to a place where I'm managing a lot of accounts on my own. I also have a huge case of imposter syndrome, even though all my clients are happy with my performance and consistently refer me to their friends.

So, here are my questions for you all:

1. When did you first become sure that your work was valuable and that you deserved your position?
2. How did you handle the scaling stage—the point where you could step back from the time-consuming tasks to focus on developing the business and delegate work to others?

7,"If you’ve ever said “It’s just faster if I do it myself,” read this.",Entrepreneur,The-Business-Guru,55,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1lu4v1w/if_youve_ever_said_its_just_faster_if_i_do_it/,"I’ve worked with a lot of founders and operators, and this is the most common bottleneck I see. ***It feels faster to do it yourself.*** You know how you want it done, and explaining it sounds like more work than just getting it done.

But that mindset is exactly what keeps businesses stuck. You don’t scale by doing everything yourself. You scale by building systems other people can run.

I often tell my clients they need to shift from RUNNING a business to BUILDING a business. Those are different muscles to flex in a business.

If you’re in this trap, here are five ops tips that help get you out of the weeds:

1. **Document it once, delegate it forever** If you’ve done a task more than twice, record a Loom and write a quick step-by-step. Done is better than perfect.
2. **Use a task manager, not your memory** Your brain should focus on decisions, not reminders. Use ClickUp, Notion, Asana, or even a sticky note system. Just pick one and stick with it.
3. **Set default decisions** Take away decision fatigue. Example: invoices go out on Fridays, client emails get answered at 10 and 3. The more defaults, the faster your day moves.
4. **Hire for outcomes, not hours** Don’t pay someone to “help.” Define what success looks like, hand it off, and let them own it.
5. **Build for the team you don’t have yet** If the business only works when you’re touching everything, you don’t have a business. You have a job with a fancy title. Build it so someone else could run it tomorrow.

What’s one system or change that helped you step back and actually focus on growth?

Would love to hear what’s worked for others."

7,First client mad about having to pay for work after saying she'd pay for work,freelance,davelipus,20,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1kawm1j/first_client_mad_about_having_to_pay_for_work/,"Maybe this issue is as old as website work, but we're just starting out as a team in freelancing (my partner and I, though I did this as an amateur years ago), and she found a great client whom we're willing to do some free work for while learning the ropes again (especially to get something on the portfolio besides my tangential employee stuff), but had said she's willing to pay when the time comes. I mentioned a flat fee for releasing the website, but that we may charge hourly for changes beyond that or for back-n-forth work that may be extraneous to a minimum-viable product (MVP).

After we'd gone through several iterations of the site (all good learning experiences for us, maybe 25 hours of work all around, and not a complicated site), when the time came to release, she put it off and requested more changes, this time more deletions of previous work or re-wording or moving things around... it just began to feel like more busywork and delays than any sort of progress.

When I then mentioned payment for the release, an expected deadline, a site design for MVP, and hourly pay for re-doing things, she got upset and acted as if we never agreed to any payment, and is now threatening to not continue with the site and a sister site that we spent some hours on investigating and poking around with.

Unfortunately there's no formal written agreement, the business isn't registered yet, all we have is a brand website and our text/email communications (no meeting/call recordings since we've been easy-going and she's been super-nice). Frankly I don't understand the aggressive turn-around, and she spent more money with the previous people whose work she didn't like even though they didn't drop the ball on anything that I saw.

**Endpoint:** So, now that I'm back in the fray, what do you suggest for this client? My partner will try to salve things over through phone (since my comments were in email), but it appears the client misread and forgot about a lot of things discussed, and her personality didn't come off earlier as being anything like a deadbeat. She makes a lot of money and our charges are far lower than the standard.

Also any advice for new clients, I'm looking into getting contracts and a ramp-up workflow going (especially with project management), but it looks like it's gonna take a lot of time and possibly mistakes to get a smooth process from discussion to payment."

I know opinions will differ but want to hear as many folks’ thoughts as possible.

I’ve felt stuck because my full-time job leaves very little energy for a side-hustle that would eventually turn freelance. I’m wondering if the right move may be going “cold turkey” and putting all my effort toward building a freelancing business.

The main risk for this is lack of a paycheck for a while. If I build a cushion of savings, what’s the right amount of time where you’d think the chance of making it work is good? Is 1 year long enough?

I’m talking starting at zero - no clients, no leads. If it helps, I’m in data analytics, currently somewhere between IC and management.

To make the success criteria a little clearer, in one year I’d like to be able to cover my living expenses from freelancing (not trying to replace my salary, I know that would take longer).

7,Pivoted into Fractional CTO consulting after 25 years in engineering - ask me anything or share advice,consulting,CarefulLight4214,28,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1lpd4tf/pivoted_into_fractional_cto_consulting_after_25/,"I recently made the leap from full-time staff engineer to Fractional CTO.

I’d been thinking about it for years, but finally pulled the trigger once I realized:

- I loved mentoring and cross-team work more than deep IC work

- Founders often desperately need tech clarity without full-time hires

- I wanted more autonomy, variety and long-term impact

Now I work 10–15 hrs/week with early-stage SaaS/startup teams - helping with architecture, infra, AI integration, and team coaching.

Would love to hear:

- Your experiences as fractional/independent consultants

- How you structure your retainers or short-term gigs

- What worked (and what didn’t) when you started out

Happy to answer anything in return - I’ve built real-time infra, wallets, observability systems, and spent a lot of time coaching dev teams.

**Edit 05/07:**

I've had a few people ask if I offer a free 30-minute intro call. I appreciate the question, and I wanted to share my answer publicly in case it helps others:

**I don’t believe real value fits neatly into a calendar slot.**

Instead, my approach is simple:

I’ll work with you for as long as it takes to figure out where (or if) I can truly help your business.

That might be one meeting or a few async chats or it might take a bit longer if we need to dig into architecture, scaling challenges, or product/tech alignment.

If, at the end of that exploration, we both feel there’s value in working together, we’ll figure out a fair engagement.

If not, no worries, no charge. You’ll still leave with some clarity or recommendations you can use.

I care about helping first and only charging when it’s clear I’m making a meaningful difference.

If you’re a founder struggling with tech scaling, AI/product fit, or team enablement, happy to explore if I can help. And if not, hopefully I can point you to someone who can."

(tested and proven model to start new or revive older projects)",juststart,jamesackerman1234,36,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1l2gv1x/ama_case_studies_5_6_7figure_affiliate_content/,"Hello Everyone,

Old member here and I published 5, 6, 7-figures affiliate website (and display ads) case studies here. I shared the complete process including niche selection, KW research, content plan, production, backlinks and optimisation.

**However with AI and how search is done now, nothing seems to work now:** affiliate sites, content brands, SEO, content marketing etc. all seems to be dead.

*However, based on 1-2y of recent testing - a different approach to the same model works.* 

By changing your approach, strategy and right infrastructure, you can actually get the same results (if not better) with lesser effort (due to AI).

**The purpose of this post is to share my findings (and hard data) from the past 1-2 years so you can potentially start new projects, revive older ones, grow traffic, have successful exits, passive income, generate leads for local business or even sell digital or physical products/services through organic traffic.**

While it doesn't apply to all cases, it does to most. Hope this helps.

**Feel free to ask questions, if any. It's an AMA.**

Before I share what works now, what doesn't and more; here's the past case studies for reference:

In terms of content marketing, SEO, traffic generation and monetisation, I'll try and share:

* Overview (traditional model, valuation, issues)
* Fundamentals (what used to work and what works now) - comparison table
* What works now (summary)
* Process (detailed steps)
* Finding a niche
* Validation of service based pages
* Validation of information based posts
* Site structure
* Content production
* Backlinks
* What to do with projects that lost traffic?
* Summary

**Overview**

*Basic model:* Traditionally, you created a content website in a particular niche, wrote content and built links (all after a thorough market research, niche selection, KW research and site structure). You drove organic traffic and monetised it through display ads and various affiliate programs (most popular being, Amazon affiliate). You sometimes sold your own products as well.

*Valuation:* These projects were valued at 30-40x their average monthly revenue for the past 6-12 months.

*Issues:*

1. Due to AI, anyone can write and spam the internet with content
2. Google shows results from Gemini now and the top ranking websites are pushed down
3. A lot of people just search for solutions on ChatGPT, Gemini or other AI platforms

I am sure, most of you know that a lot has changed and chances are thin that it's going to work like it used to.

In the following sections, I will try and draw a comparison of what worked and what has higher chance of working now.

**Fundamentals (that work now)**

|Parameter|What worked|What works now|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Type of website|Affiliate/display ads content blog|Services website with a thorough blog section|
|Positioning|Blog, info site, educational content, reviews|Proper business that offers services, has service pages like ""book xyz service"" and has a blog section to educate about the same niche|
|Strategy|Find a niche with a lot of products to promote, passionate audience, enough audience, affiliate programs and display ads|Create an actual service/product based business (not as hard to do), offer (or not) easy to deliver services/products, have a blog section to drive traffic|
|Monetisation|Ads, affiliate|Ads, affiliate but product/service sales as well|
|Growth strategy|More content and backlinks|Content, backlinks, reviews, testimonials, social media, and most importantly automating service delivery (in case of service) or digital products|

**What works now (summary)**

* An actual service/product (digital) business
* With proper Google by business and reviews (very easy to do)
* Proper NAP (name, address, phone number)
* Positioned as a proper brand/company
* Having bulk service pages ""book xyz in PQR"" etc.
* Blog section with enough pages to drive organic traffic

**Process (how it works)**

In summary, what used to work can still work but the approach, positioning, strategy and especially how you're actually going to do is different.

I will use an example of ""lead generation for dentists""

Through this example, I will give an overview of steps and explain them (if something is unclear, feel free to ask questions in detail):

1. Finding a niche (example: lead generation for dentists)
2. Validating if you can create a service or digital product around it (yes: ""lead gen for dentist in Houston Texas"") -- structure is ""lead gen for dentist in &lt;location&gt;
3. Validating if you can devise a simple structure to create bulk service pages (yes: you can create different pages in terms of services offered and the location -- example: lead generation for teeth scaling in Texas, Houston"" - here the structure is: ""lead gen &lt;name of service&gt; in &lt;location&gt;""
4. Checking if there are enough info based queries for lead gen in general (yes: how to do lead gen etc.)
5. Validating if there are businesses offering ""lead gen services for dentists"" (yes: look for their business structure, site structure, services offered, reviews, testimonials etc.)
6. If it exists, note it down - we can use it later for reverse engineering
7. Create site structure (pages for services and posts into categories and subcategories for informational content)
8. For pages and posts: extract top ranking results, their structure, flow and other information to produce content
9. Then, organise this structure, remove duplicate headings and create a template for content (for both pages and posts)
10. The pages especially will follow the same structure of content and you can use AI to bulk produce content and publish it
11. Same with posts
12. Offsite: backlinks, listings, reviews etc.

**Finding a niche**

There are multiple ways to do it but if you're just getting started. I would suggest opening Google maps and browse for the kind of services based businesses there. Browse and analyse if you can create a similar services based business and then follow through the steps I mentioned above.

There are other technical ways of doing that but I don't want to drag this on for too long.

Quick tip: Any query that doesn't return Google Gemini's response is a good one (mostly).

**Validation of service pages potential**

Open those businesses' sites and explore if there are service pages and location based pages as these seem to be the most important variables in the page title structure.

Ideally check for 10-20 business websites for validation.

**Validation of information based posts**

* Open Ahrefs
* Keywords explorer tab
* Enter the source keyword like lead generation etc.
* Location to USA (or wherever you are)
* Filter: Questions
* If there are at least 2500 keywords and combined search volume of over 50,000 - you're good to go

Once you have this, you will extract all these keywords and sort the similar ones into clusters to form articles.

**Site Structure**

The site structure is divided into three main categories:

* Essential pages: Home page, about us, privacy policy, affiliates disclaimer, content us
* Service pages: Bulk pages to showcase services like ""Book &lt;name of service&gt; in &lt;location&gt;"" or ""Book &lt;type of service&gt; in &lt;location&gt;""
* Posts: These are informational posts related to the main topic. Let's say the main topic is ""lead generation"" - then possible topics could be: ""how to do lead gen for local businesses"". You can even create categories and subcategories if required. For smaller sites, don't bother.
* Sitemap: Generate one to show categories, posts, pages, authors.

**Content Production**

Here are the steps (almost the same for posts and pages):

* Define a query structure (example: ""book &lt;xyz service&gt; in &lt;location&gt;""
* Insert a query in Google
* Extract top 10 results
* Note down their headings, content and tone
* Remove duplicate headings
* Order them
* Do this for at least 5 queries
* This way you will have 5 templates
* Combine info from all, remove duplicates, re-order and then create one single template
* This will be used to write content for 1000s of pages that follow the same query template: ""book &lt;xyz service&gt; in &lt;location&gt;""

You can use AI to produce content and I have mentioned that extensively in 2 of my other case studies. This one is already too long and I don't want to drag it further. If you do have questions, let me know.

**Backlinks**

I would suggest start with at least 10 backlinks that are:

* Dofollow
* Content based
* Permanent
* With anchor text of your choice
* DR &gt; 15
* Ahrefs search traffic &gt; 150

However, in this case - it's important to get links from local business listings as well.

**What about your sites that lost traffic?**

One of the best ways to do that out of many is to: reposition the site as a proper business and not a blog. Publish more relevant and contextual context in this regard and build more local and relevant backlinks to get started. Of course a lot more needs to be done but that's a start.

I do have a list of things to do, so feel free to let me know. I might be able to share some of the points.

**Summary**

With this approach, which is essentially - repositioning of your affiliate sites, you can significantly see the odds of success. Of course there are other ways as well and I might share those in future posts.

In the past couple of years, we saw a lot of affiliate sites fail and that's fine.

The shift in the industry has never been bigger and I am not surprised to see this. However, in midst of all this, I am also glad since the costs to run these projects has gone significantly down due to AI.

Yes, things that used to work are no longer working but we shouldn't emotionally attach to the processes. In my experience, adapting is important and adapting faster is even more important.

As my team and I run more experiments, things will become clearer. But, I can say confidently that it's a lot easier to achieve passive income, drive traffic and sell these projects due to AI. It's going to take some time to adapt the models but it looks highly efficient and promising.

I hope this helps. If you have any questions, feel free to let me know.

PS If you worked on some projects and have some hard data, do share. I would love to learn more.

Cheers and best of luck!"
7,niche sites are a thing of the past - what do we juststart now?,juststart,ScHaKaLaKa___,118,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1hstre8/niche_sites_are_a_thing_of_the_past_what_do_we/,"This post is inspired by the posts of u/[wavearcade](/user/wavearcade/). Similar to him my several content niche site in the home improvement segment tanked massively during 2023 HCU and stagnated afterwards. The daily visitors dropped by a whooping 80% and so did the earnings from these sites. 

Unfortunately I missed the ""golden times"" of niche sites, but even if the sites were still rather small and still growing they earned me about 2 - 3 k a month. Afterwards the most recent updates I only earn 100-200 with the sites. I tried to change many things but nothing worked...Google clearly wants to get rid of niche affiliate sites.  
Fun fact: I created a E-Com with a small blog and was selling my own products as a reaction after the HCU 23 update. This was growing surprisingly well during last year and guess what....December Spam Update happened and tanked the traffic 60%. This job really takes a toll on ones mental health I can't deny.

All members of this subreddit clearly have a passion for internet related work. But where are we heading know? I'm sure there are many people in a similar situation looking for a path in the future.   
So I would like to ask what are your plans for 2025? SAAS, AI, Newsletter, YouTube or do you thin there is still a chance for niche sites? Let's discuss!"
7,Month 2 of building my startup after being laid off - $200 in revenue and 4 (actual) paying customers,juststart,WhosAfraidOf_138,96,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1gmnut5/month_2_of_building_my_startup_after_being_laid/,"In September 2024, I got laid off from my Silicon Valley job. It fucking sucked. I took a day to be sad, then got to work - I'm not one to wallow, I prefer action. Updated my resume, hit up my network, started interviewing.

During this time, I had a realization - I'm tired of depending on a single income stream. I needed to diversify. Then it hit me: I literally work with RAG (retrieval augmented generation) in AI. Why not use this knowledge to help small businesses reduce their customer service load and boost sales?

One month later, Answer HQ 0.5 (the MVP) was in the hands of our first users (shoutout to these alpha testers - their feedback shaped everything). By month 2, [Answer HQ 1.0](answerhq.co) launched with four paying customers, and growing.

You're probably thinking - great, another chatbot.

Yes, Answer HQ is a chatbot at its core. But here's the difference: it actually works. Our paying customers are seeing real results in reducing support load, plus it has something unique - it actively drives sales by turning customer questions into conversions. How? The AI doesn't just answer questions, it naturally recommends relevant products and content (blogs, social media, etc).

Since I'm targeting small business owners (who usually aren't tech wizards) and early startups, Answer HQ had to be dead simple to set up. Here's my onboarding process - just 4 steps. I've checked out competitors like Intercom and Crisp, and I can say this: if my non-tech fiancée can set up an assistant on her blog in minutes, anyone can.

Key learnings so far:

- Building in public is powerful. I shared my journey on Threads and X, and the support for a solo founder has been amazing.

- AI dev tools (Cursor, Claude Sonnet 3.5) have made MVP development incredibly accessible. You can get a working prototype frontend ready in days. I don't see how traditional no-code tools can survive in this age. 

- But.. for a production-ready product? You still need dev skills and background. Example: I use Redis for super-fast loading of configs and themes. An AI won't suggest this optimization unless you know to ask for it. Another example: Cursor + Sonnet 3.5 struggles with code bases with many files and dependencies. It *will* change things you don't want it to change. Unless you can read code + understand it + know what needs to be changed and not changed, you'll easily run into upper limits of what prompting alone can do. 

- I never mention ""artificial intelligence"" ""AI"" ""machine learning"" or any of these buzzwords once in my copy in my landing page, docs, product, etc. There is no point. Your customers *do not care* that something has AI in it. AI is not the product. Solving their pain points and problems is the product. AI is simply a tool of many tools like databases, APIs, caching, system design, etc. 

- Early on, I personally onboarded every user through video calls. Time-consuming? Yes. But it helped me deeply understand their pain points and needs. I wasn't selling tech - I was showing them solutions to their problems.

- Tech stack: NextJS/React/Tailwind/shadcn frontend, Python FastAPI backend. Using Supabase Postgres, Upstash Redis, and Pinecone for different data needs. Hosted on Vercel and Render.com.

- Customer growth: Started with one alpha tester who saw such great results (especially in driving e-commerce sales) that he insisted on paying for a full year to keep me motivated. This led to two monthly customers, then a fourth annual customer after I raised prices. My advisor actually pushed me to raise prices again, saying I was undercharging for the value provided. I have settled on my final pricing now. 

- I am learning so much. Traditionally, I have a software development and product management background. I am weak in sales and marketing. Building that app, designing the architecture, talking to customers, etc, these are all my strong suits. I enjoy doing it too. But now I need to improve on my ability to market the startup and really start learning things like SEO, content marketing, cold outreach, etc. I enjoying learning new skills. 

Happy to answer any questions about the journey so far!"
7,Blogging Case Study #3 - 1 year in (100 posts written),juststart,mrstarling95,39,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1f9xw05/blogging_case_study_3_1_year_in_100_posts_written/,"Hi all - some of you may remember my previous posts where I discussed prgress on a blog that I set up following u/Philreddit7's technique in targeting low-competition keywords. While my 3-monthly Reddit updates stopped, I continued blogging in the background.

Today, I noticed I had written my 100th article, which is way fewer than I had hoped by this stage, but having a full-time job and life just doing what life does, that's where I am. So, I fancied writing a little post sharing how it's all going!

# Has my approach changed?

Not drastically. I still target longtail keywords or questions on Google without great choices to look at and use that as my basis. I then try fleshing it out using various keyword-searching tools (mainly Keyword Surfer) to bulk out the main questions I should answer in one article. I know Google hates keyword stuffing, and that's not my plan, but I like to know similar questions and other things people are searching for to build out my article structure.

I have started writing my articles longer, aiming more around 1,500 words as before I was writing around 1,000 words - this seems to be helping. I also begin each article title with the main keyword as I had read Google likes.

I now add an FAQ section at the bottom of articles. I don't know whether it does anything, but I see lots of blogs do it, and it looks smart. Similarly, I now drop the first paragraph case as I read; it captures the reading more (I'm not sure this is true, but I like it).

I have been rewriting old articles that were not performing well and updating them to this new style, and many have improved quite a lot!

# Numbers overall for this past year

**Overall in the past 12 months (Google):** 15.7k clicks, 895k impressions, Average CTR 1.8%, Average position 13.6. So far, in the last 30 days, I have had 4,600 sessions.

**Overall, in the past 12 months (Ahrefs - I can't do the full year without a paid version):** Domain Rating (DR) 2.3, URL Rating (UR) 4.7, Backlinks 40, Ref. domains 23, Keywords 3.3k.

**Article positions:** I have 11 in the top position on Google Search, 7 in the 2-10 bracket, and about 30 in the 11-20 bracket, with the rest not doing too well.

My blog was pretty lacklustre for traffic until around 6/7 months, when there was a much larger curve in my performance. I have seen a tiny down-spike for the first time, which I attribute to the latest Google update.

# General Reflections and Next Steps

I am not sure this project will ever be profitable, not now with Google's 'AI Overview', which removes the point of reaching top rankings on Google. However, I still really enjoy it and am learning so much about my topic, which I love. This is my **top tip**; otherwise, you will burn out and give up.

I am still terrible at Social Media, but this will be my next adventure to try and grow a returning audience, as I mostly have new visitors from Google searches. This will probably be Facebook and Pinterest, but I am interested in YouTube! If anyone has any tips for being effective via social media, that would be helpful, as I'm hopeless!

I am interested in connecting with other sites and possibly guest writing something or promoting some of my articles on other sites/businesses. This is all new to me, but I'm really eager to diversify my traffic, especially since I mentioned that Google does not look like a good space for old-school blogs.

I'm considering adding new AI features to my website to give it a new 'function'. I'm still exploring and may add a Chatbot for users to ask questions about my niche tailored, where an AI 'expert' could answer questions and perhaps point them to my articles with the same/similar keywords, but I have no idea where to start. Any tips would be appreciated, as when it comes to AI, I figured if you can't beat 'em, join 'em!

# Finally...

If you made it this far, I will continue writing and see what the next year (and 100 articles) brings me. My aim is when (and if) I get to 10,000 sessions a month, I will put Ads on the website to garner a little beer money, but let's see!

I always welcome tips from anyone, so please do feel free to reach out! But just as an FYI for those selling services, I ain't buying.

7,Google Is 100% Going After SEO Optimized Sites (right now everybody is a liar willingly or not),juststart,The190IQ_Equalizer,92,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1ezxl8i/google_is_100_going_after_seo_optimized_sites/,"Here's the deal. 

The Income School method is dead and the only one refusing to admit that is Riki since his company depends on that. 

But that's a fact. He has 240k subs and people barely watch his videos. 

Back in the day, a video of their would rack 30k views easily. 

Why? 

It was hard enough to make this happen when it worked (back when they were two instead of one) and now it's simply impossible. 

The fact is GOOGLE is PENALIZING SEO-optimized sites that have no DR 90 or something. 

What I mean by that is this:

if you use the soup method (like every IS site), google treats you like spam. 

And it's been 11 months since that happened. And every subsequent update is REAFFIRMING THAT. 

Right now there is the August update that is essentially looking for sites missed billed old-school style during 2024 only to kill them. 

==================

I was screaming this back in Sep, Oct, Nov last year to the IS channel, but not one cared. 

They all thought recovery was coming, but my intuition told me this cancer is going to stick. 

Do not pay for SEO services right now as no one really knows what to do. (It was scammy before and know people are just scammy + clueless).

I am talking about everyone. 

Back in the day, I used to believe Income School because their strategy worked and they would show it constantly

Now nothing works (at least nothing public) and they show nothing. 

The guy is bragging about some pathetic YT channel that doesn't even have 2k subs. 

The truth of the matter guys is that this industry is dying if not dead already. 

And Google doesn't seem to mind it. It's giving all the traffic to reddit. 

This months Reddit reached 1 billion views 

It's growth last year was the largest in the history of the Internet because google puts it on top of everything. 

=-=============

Sadly, it's GG.

But the grifters will keep grifting."
7,YouTube Channels’ Case Study Update Months 10-11,juststart,PhilReddit7,33,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1aqkz0n/youtube_channels_case_study_update_months_1011/,"Hello!

Would you believe we’re fast approaching a year of me documenting my latest online journey?

This stuff goes super quick (for me at least), it’s a good reminder that today is the best day to Just Start! (How cheesy, eh)

That said - and I feel like I say this every time, but I’ve been slacking again to be honest and wish I’d done more in the last couple of months, but meh.

Anyway, here’s an overview of what’s happened since the last update:

* I made a total of £5,452.49 from both channels combined in Dec-Jan.
* I had some more videos picked up by local media; didn’t drive much traffic but it’s good exposure.
* I did a content push in December on the stock channel releasing a video daily for most of the month, but hardly touched my other channel making just one video.
* I probably worked somewhere in the region of \~75-100 hours across two months.

NB - I had some hate mail last update from people saying none of this can be true without screenshots (it’s the internet, I get it), so I included a lifetime analytics screenshot for each channel:

# Channel 1 – Here’s What Happened

I still have one video responsible for 99% of the traffic and earnings on this channel. Not sure how long it will last, but it is still paying the bills.

I went hard back in December releasing a video almost every day. I wanted to test out a few different topics, headline styles, and some other things.

I didn’t really figure anything out, to be honest. It’s tough cracking the algo with this channel and I can’t seem to get any decent momentum with the subs or the audience.

But, it’s all good. There is a minimal expense involved, and I still get to sharpen my skills with every video I make.

# Channel 2 – Here’s What Happened

  
This is the channel where I love making the content. I get to go out and visit places across the UK, interview people, film interesting places and things, and it’s been a blast.

My main issue is that I go out filming with a friend as it’s so much easier and more fun that way, but he’s been really busy.

He actually has a job, would you believe. He’d love to change that if this channel provided a full-time income, and I believe that could happen if we can get out often enough.

We didn’t go out for weeks, but we have been out a couple of times in the last few weeks so I have some footage in the pipeline to release a couple of videos.

I’ve been targeting newsworthy topics in recent videos which is something I said I wanted to do in a previous update.

It’s been working really well. I’ve been featured several times in the local and national media, I’ve even been ‘recognised’ 3-4 times by random people now. (It’s a faceless channel, but as soon as I explain what I do they ask if I'm ‘the guy from that \[name\] channel’).

Online media doesn’t send a lot of traffic my way, unfortunately, the journalists don’t often embed my videos and they tend to put a link to my channel very discreetly in the article - all tactics to keep people on their page.

# It’s Business As Usual

Going forward it’s more of the same. I’m tempted to start a new channel to fill the gaps in time between working on the others but I’m hesitant to start getting bogged down working on multiple channels.

In reality, I need to double down by persuading my friend to go out filming more and spend more time trying to crack the algo on my stock channel.

In short:

If your content isn’t original and authentic, it won’t qualify for ads.

This targets:
	•	AI content farms
	•	Repetitive video formats
	•	Low-effort automation pipelines

Even if you’re using legit tools like n8n, ChatGPT, ElevenLabs, or Pictory — if your videos feel mass-produced, you’re at risk.

They’re tightening the definition of “inauthentic” content, and that includes:
	•	Similar intros reused across videos
	•	Identical visuals with swapped-out voiceovers
	•	Language-switched clones without new value

🔍 Here’s the official update (screenshot attached)

7,Pro-Tips for packing/organizing an entire house being put in storage?,organization,balancelibertine,19,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/organization/comments/1cpoztw/protips_for_packingorganizing_an_entire_house/,"Hi, all! I'm just picking brains right now looking for tips/tricks as I start slowly tackling this project. When my lease is up at the end of this year, I plan to move back in with my mom on her request, partially to help her out around her house with some things but also to take the opportunity to save up some money for a downpayment on a house of my own. With the reduced expenses and a game plan for what I need to help her with, we're both estimating that this will take, at maximum, about two years.

So I'm going to need to pack up and store my things once my lease is up. I was thinking to start early (like in the October time frame) since I already have a climate-controlled storage unit that my mom and I split the cost on and don't have much in at the moment (it's only costing each of us $62 a month). My rental house is only about 900 square feet, and there's not a TON of furniture and stuff to store. The house is a two-bedroom, but only one is being used as a bedroom, and the other is the office, most of which is going to my mom's house. I'm trying to plot out and plan out the best way to tackle this absolutely massive project step-by-step because it's a little overwhelming, and I have ADHD and want to be able to break it down in manageable bites that I can go ahead and start on now. I'm already planning a declutter (but the extent of that plan, so far, is simply the word ""declutter"") and am already feeling overwhelmed, so I thought I'd turn to the Redditor experts on organization to ask...

Has anyone ever packed up an entire house like this and stored it for a couple of years? Any pro-tips for protecting certain types of furniture (i.e., my couch, which is technically a loveseat, not a full-size couch)? Things I should consider getting rid of versus keeping? Any suggestions and advice you can lend would be greatly appreciated!"
7,Freezer door storage for chopped veggies that allows you to break them up when they freeze into a clump?,organization,--2021--,29,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/organization/comments/1al8se8/freezer_door_storage_for_chopped_veggies_that/,"Trying to figure out how to efficiently organize my chopped condiment? veggies  on hand to add to dishes. I have a top freezer in my fridge, it has a couple shelves on the door and I'm trying to make effective use of them.

Ziplock and food storage bags are a mess, they don't stack neatly in the door, they fall out of the door on the floor, they get buried somewhere because someone is just trying to get them out of the way. It's also hard to see how much I have. Often we wind up with multiple bags of the same thing because they get ""lost"".

I tried putting canning jars in the freezer door, each jar containing a chopped vegetable: onions, garlic, peppers, green onions, chives etc

I freeze them because our apartment is hot and it's better to prep and freeze, they keep longer that way, plus when you freeze them they cook faster and are more easily digested (as one who has digestive issues).

It was great at first, kinda like having spice jars, you can grab what you need, mix and match, you know exactly how much you have by looking at it. 

But in a few days they just froze into a solid lump and I couldn't get them out of the jars. I tried freezing the veggies in ziplocks first, then smashing them up with a rubber mallet to make sure they were loose. They stayed ok for a few days then formed a solid mass again.

I need containers that will fit in the doors well, but I guess are flexible sided so I can squeeze them or smash them with a mallet to break up the clumps. Food storage bags were good for the latter but not the former."
7,Stakeholders constantly complaining about being unaware. How much of this is my problem?,projectmanagement,lurkandload,33,75,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1lrptcn/stakeholders_constantly_complaining_about_being/,"I setup a project dashboard, with live statuses from projects and their files. It’s a very simple and organized view of the entire portfolio. It shows progress %, overall status, project name/description, and an “update” comment.

This dashboard is updated live from the project files. What I’ve consistently communicated is the dashboard is useful for the summary and if you want details, you can review the full project file.

Everyone in the org has automatic access to the software/tools/system.

There’s no reason they can’t review the dashboard, if they have questions they can review the full project file, and if they have more questions they can reach out to anyone on the team or myself and ask.

Despite all of this, my boss and the leadership team I am part of seem to be talking amongst themselves about how this process is not meeting their needs. 

I say this because within 2 weeks, each of them have brought up to me that they aren’t confident in certain projects. (And other non-positive feedback).

My boss also says she needs to see a specific plan for who is doing what by when, etc.

I have had this exact information decided/planned for 6 months and have had it saved in the common location for anyone to review.


The bottom line for how I see it is - I am providing consistent information and have setup systems for everyone to interact with that information. The real problem is that they aren’t engaging with any of it and instead are making assumptions that I’m just simply bad at my job or something.

My boss and I have never clicked, I started reporting to her 6 months ago. I used to love my job, I now can’t stand it. She is condescending and constantly changing her mind and canceling work that I’ve invested weeks of time in.

For example, I started a content outline for a training plan to get project owners to the same baseline. I brought it to a 1:1 and said “do you think this is worth continuing?” She was super excited, “yes this is exactly what we need I love it”. A week later, at our next 1:1, “hey I need you to stop work on the training plan and just use corporate training”… 

So, I wasted a week of my time. And the corporate training is just a sharepoint site with click-through “modules” etc. completely different from the problem I was trying to solve.

Regardless - this was not intended to be a rant about my boss. 

Does anyone have any experience or advice I can lean on for this? 

Thank you!

EDIT ———

Adding one of my comments below, for context:

My stakeholders for this issue specifically are just the others on my team - functional managers.

My previous boss specifically asked for the dashboard because everything was so chaotic at first, we needed a single place for all projects.

And yes, I’ve been begging for requests / feedback / suggestions for 1.5 years.

I tried emailing requesting feedback, and following up with reminders to say I haven’t gotten a response.. no response

I’ve tried ms forms links, so all they have to do is click an answer.. maybe I would get 2 or 3 out of 12 to respond.

I called a recurring meeting with JUST us, the leadership team, every two weeks. I sent out a poll/asked directly before hand what day works best for them… and still, they would show up late or not at all, with no notice.

In that meeting I presented a communication plan, complete with slides/templates and overall strategy - I highlighted what’s new/different, and I asked for their feedback on the plan.

I also directly said “this is me asking you for help”

It took us 3 meetings like this, with no progress or agreement, for me to just give up and cancel the meeting.

The best way to describe it is, to them, it doesn’t matter until it matters.. and wouldn’t you know it, it’s time for mid-year reviews and suddenly everyone is very interested in projects"
7,"Problem project. Not a PM, but trying to learn!",projectmanagement,bloopityb00p,7,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1ln3065/problem_project_not_a_pm_but_trying_to_learn/,"Hi, everyone. I'm not a officially Project Manager, but I feel like I can pick up skills from the PM skill set and apply them to the work I do.

I work for a small electrical supplies distributor. I don't really have a job title - if I have to put something down, I usually put ""Inside Sales"" or ""Sales Associate."" My actual duties entail quoting customers, processing orders, placing orders for material, working with my warehouse to coordinate deliveries, and fielding customer questions and providing updates. Often, I'm supporting a salesman who has gotten an order, but does not have the organizational capabilities to execute (a good chunk of the salesmen are elderly). I mainly utilize Excel and Google Sheets, and my company uses a CRM (Creatio) to keep track of daily tasks.

In November, we were awarded a contract by a longtime customer to supplies thousands of LED lamps and lighting fixtures to several facilities. The salesman who bid this contract is an owner of my company who has been working with this customer since the 80's, so he was very pleased to get this. However, the project of fulfilling these huge orders has been very fraught from the beginning. The customer made several demands that put us in a bad position: they rushed us to order material at a pace our warehouse struggled to keep up with, made us store the material for longer than agreed, and made us swap out one brand of lamp for another, which cost us in return fees and labor.

When material was finally delivered (6+ months after we ordered this material for them), the customer reported huge material shortages. Because we held onto this material so long, we are out of the period where we can request no-cost replacements and are on the hook financially for this missing material. We've been able to locate some of the stuff (our leadership made our warehouse do a rigorous check of what we still had in-house, and even I dug through boxes to find materials my warehouse had missed), but we are still missing about $12k worth of material.

I have ultimately escalated this to management and the salesman to resolve. I can't order $12k worth of stuff and give it to the customer as free replacements without approval - my hands are tied. I've also had a bit of a hard time communicating with this customer - I've tried to get ahead of certain things with them, but they are not super responsive by email. I've spoken to them on the phone and asked them to review the list of missing materials so they can confirm we're on the same page about what's missing, and explained my management's reluctance to re-order things, but these were more junior members of the customer's team, and they never gave meaningful feedback to my prompting.

I do think I ultimately messed up by not over-communicating regarding this particular situation and not covering myself better. They weren't really expediting aggressively, but I believe I am at least partially responsible for a communication breakdown occurring. One of the customer's project leaders finally asked ""when are we getting this stuff?"" Obviously, his junior colleagues have not clued him in on what's going on, and I'm certain he's going to be angry about the delay it will cause for the project on his end (our customer is managing the installation of the lights). Both myself and management agree that the salesman ultimately needs to speak with them to resolve this and establish the direction we're taking, because I've more or less hit a wall and don't have the authority to fix it by myself.

Now that I've written this novel (and it's still very abridged), here's where I'm curious about PM resources and skills. I'm of the opinion that this project was not well-planned from the beginning, the salesman did not push back enough the customer's demands and control their expectations, and there wasn't really a process in place to mitigate risk. I don't have a team to delegate tasks to: other than the warehouse who is physically handling the material, it's only been me performing tasks to complete the orders and interfacing with the customer.

Should another project like this land in my lap, what can I do to try and coordinate things better from the beginning? Where can I learn about risk assessment/mitigation and bring it up to my management? What are the best practices for communicating with a customer who's difficult to communicate with? Are there any PM tools that might be helpful? I consider myself pretty organized and detail-oriented, but this project really threw everybody for a loop, and I would like to develop whatever skills I can to try and prevent something like this from ever happening again. 

If you have taken the time to read this post, I really appreciate it. I would love any advice/tips you can offer. Thank you!"

3. Communication tracking
4. Integration with ""Jackrabbit Technologies,"" which is our class management system.
5. Marketing tools would be a nice plus

Talent Management side needs

2. Role-specific sorting - age, ethnicity, height, special skills
3. Availability tracking - blackout dates, school schedules
4. Project submission tracking/audition &amp; callback log/booking history

I run the alumni organization for my alma mater in my state. We exist to 1) build community among alumni and 2) raise scholarship funds for students from our state attending the University.

We currently operate on a poorly maintained University-provided Web Outlook account. I am looking for a very simple and affordable CRM, focused on organizing our data and streamlining communication.

Ideally performs just the following functions:

+ Has a built-in and customizable contact form for people to ‘register with us’ at events 
+ Email (Gmail) and SMS (Twilio or similar) integration, so I can communicate with the contact from within the CRM and see my conversation history
+ Bulk Email and SMS campaigns
+ Mobile version


Don’t want:
+ Too many modules- Hubspot and many like it are far too complex for what I need. I don’t need Deals, Accounts, or other extraneous modules
+ High monthly cost - we’re a charity volunteer org. Every dollar possible needs to go to scholarships

Not promoting anything, just want to talk about it - partly for self-therapy, partly to discover if there's anything else I could've done. And hopefully someone learns something new from my experience!

***EDIT - I realised I should've mentioned this is to build a database of company financials (assets, income, etc) rather than profiles.***

**Background**

I'd been mulling on the idea for a few years, then started looking properly into it. I found there's already a vendor for UK company data that specifically caters to SMEs. However, you couldn't build complex filters on their UI, and they didn't have a reasonably-priced offering for bulk data. That was enough to convince me to give it a go - not great, I know.

**MVP development**

There was a lot to figure out, so I focused on the most important piece of the puzzle - the ingestion of the financial statement filings. Even that was a pain; I needed 3 months to get a working prototype, and I realised it's quite expensive to run - about $4k to process all the accounts for a given year. I decided to extract financials only for a month, to keep the costs low, and built a very basic landing page that showed the data.

**Validation**

I started by posting on LinkedIn, not that I had a big following, but I didn't know what else to do. One person reached out after seeing my posts - he was an analyst at a small private equity firm. The ideal customer!

However, it died down after a few meetings/conversations. Turns out private equity firms don’t assess acquisition opportunities by looking at individual companies. They research industries that are ripe for disruption, then look to acquire any businesses in that segment that are up for sale. Financial fundamentals play much lesser importance, and they can’t go for companies outside of their criteria as they wouldn’t have the know-how to operate them.

I also looking into the lead list building angle, but I didn't have contact details in my database. So I gave up on the project.

**Conclusion**

Looking back, I realise I wasted so much time (and a bit of money) by building the product without any validation. What I should’ve done, instead, is buy a subscription to an existing financial database, then immediately reach out to people that fit my customer personas, offering to build them a list of companies using that subscription.

And that's it - lengthy, I know. Hopefully it was useful, let me know if you have any questions/feedback!"

Here's a little background - About a month ago, I started as the head of marketing at a family owned company. The company is very well known in one industry, but they don't have a very strong brand. They've also never really had a marketing plan/budget or structure. I have large corporate and start-up experience, but I've never seen a company run quite like this.

This company is nearly over 100 years old and they definitely have been incredibly lucky with their longevity. However, it's clear in the past decade their brand equity has slipped to a competitor who clearly has a brand strategy and marketing budget.

One of the reasons they hired me is because of my experience, but as a one person department and the lack of structure from the top...I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. I know what should be done, but I need help.

Without giving too much away, here is some additional context:

• Nearly 70 years ago the founder revolutionized sports safety by inventing a new piece of equipment. This is the industry that they are very well known and respected, however there is one main competitor in this sport who has started to creep into their marketshare.

• Most of their customers are B2B (schools, gym clubs, etc), however they want to expand into a DTC with some of their products.

• I want to push PR, social (industry specific content, grow voice of authority on other sports industry they have products, but are not as well known, and B2B reach), and SEO.

• We need to refine our brand identity.

• We absolutely need to optimize our website experience. They are currently using Shopify.

• They use Hubspot for CRM and email.

• The company is located in Pennsylvania. 

But here's they thing...I have little to no budget right now. For the remainder of the year, I've been told I have about $150,000 (though I am certain the family will invest more, once they see what a marketing strategy can do.)

**So...if you were in this situation, what agencies would you RFP? With this budget, what are some of my options here?**

We run a DTC store selling aftermarket car parts, mostly performance mods and accessories. One constant headache has been abandoned checkouts. We’d get hundreds each week, especially for higher-ticket items, and email/SMS reminders only did so much.

What ended up working surprisingly well was using voice calls to follow up on abandoned carts. Not a call center, we tried that and it felt clunky. Instead, we started using this custom AI voice agent that reaches out a few minutes after someone leaves the site. It speaks naturally, answers basic questions, and nudges them to complete the order. All automatically...

I was skeptical at first, but it’s been recovering over $50k/month in otherwise lost revenue. It works especially well with our audience, people tend to trust a real-sounding voice more when spending $300+ on performance parts.

It wasn’t an off-the-shelf solution either, it was built and optimized specifically for our use case, including handling the kinds of objections we usually get on the phone (shipping questions, compatibility doubts, etc.).

I run a clothing brand in India that offers print-on-demand apparel with customized packaging. We produce a variety of products including regular and oversized t-shirts, sweatshirts, hoodies, and crop tops. We also provide DTF, DTG, and screen printing, along with custom neck labels and branded packaging.

I am specifically looking to secure bulk orders from domestic clients such as boutiques, retailers, and private label brands. But I would prefer to avoid typical online marketing channels like Instagram or other social media promotions.

I would appreciate any suggestions on platforms, directories, trade shows, local networks, or offline strategies that could help me reach businesses interested in buying in bulk within India. Also open to hearing about your experiences with building B2B relationships in this sector.

Thanks in advance for your advice and recommendations. (Modified using Chatgpt)"

6,Wow this placed absolutely died - How about jump starting activity here again? I'm going to launch a new site based on an existing site that I have that got hit by HCU.,juststart,BallerGiraffes,37,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1et7rp4/wow_this_placed_absolutely_died_how_about_jump/,"Had a site that was doing well and got hit by HCU. Still ranked first page for most of my higher volume queries, but not high enough to get clicks so traffic has fallen off of a cliff.

HCU only increased my appetite so I started putting in major work to this site hoping that once the algorithm got updated I could benefit. Almost a year later and that obviously hasn't happen.

About two months ago I decided to take a break from SEO for a few months while I relaxed and didn't let the SEO stress affect me so much.

But I'm back in.

I bought a domain similar to the old one, to be honest probably even better, and am in the process now of rebuilding the site.

I developed some stellar works flows and automations for my content creation process and I think that within this niche I have a strong possibility of becoming an authority source.

This niche involved a variety of brands / products / companies and I had reached out to many of these brand's PR and media departments directly and set up relationships with them for content. I had many of the brands tell me how much they liked my original site and how helpful it was. But apparently Google felt that it wasn't helpful, go figure!

So I have direct access to content that isn't yet available elsewhere online, a pipeline for getting it curated and written up to be posted on the site, and some sweet automation workflows for posting to social media.

I also mixed in some of the alt-SEO strategies that popped up from major influencers post HCU such as building out a Facebook page with a Likes campaign, building a couple of different sites up to thousands of followers for pretty damn cheap, I have social profiles on other sites with all of the content syndicated to be posted when the new WordPress post is created. Nothing that uncommon, but I made the process with [Make.com](http://Make.com) rather than a tool like HootSuite or Later because those are expensive as hell and Make let's me fully customize the process for like $15 a month with nearly unlimited use for my use case.

I have some AI tools to help me take the content of my WordPress posts, curate the content into a 30 second or so long video, and will get those posted to TikTok and YouTube. This content is more informational rather than attempting to go viral. Any extra views or clicks that can be gained from this are welcome, but I'm not expecting these to really be a major source of traffic. If anything, I could see the content from these videos being seen as super helpful allowing me to build decent followings on these platforms directly and that helping transform my revenue sources. A decent following a companies would easily pay for partnered content within this niche.

So it's time to give it another go. There aren't many competitors in this space, it was actually quite shocking when I first decided to look it up. It's a very common niche, ubiquitous across everyday life, and I think even with the BS we're seeing from Google, the overall scope of digital marketing and media has me in a viable position.

I've just done the basics so far, getting WordPress installed, adding my plugins and getting those setup, installing the theme and changing all the settings. 

Next up is adding the pages, starting with a drip-feed approach for them to get published. I believe Google has directly spoken about sites with a large number of posts or pages all getting published within a very short amount of time being an obvious sign that something fishy may be going on, so even though I have \~75 or so static pages ready to go, I'm going to hold off and slowly build the site up over time rather than flipping the switch and having everything be active all at once.

Going to focus on better content organization this time around as I had some of those things on my to do list last time around that I never got to that I think could be beneficial. Categorizing posts and pages better, showcasing related posts and content better, and how I write blog posts about the more upper funnel style of content rather than the direct brand / company / product specific content I had been producing previously.

I also have another 60+ domains that I purchased solely to create niche sites for and obviously that's far too much work for me to do on my own and with the current situation the viability of them may be minimal, but I know I've got some winners in there, one right now getting \~100 hits a day from Google and it's just a bunch of pictures on pages with no content. So I'm going to look towards optimizing that to be better suited for the viewers and the stuff they're looking for to see if I can generate an increase in rank.

Overall plan of mine, a long term dream goal, would be to get some of these lower tiered sites to rank and generate lower levels of revenue, attempt to sell them for whatever multiples people are paying these days, and invest in larger and more sustainable projects that aren't beholden entirely to the whims of the Google algorithm.

Nearly 20 years in experience with eCommerce, Amazon FBA, eBay, Shopify, WordPress, SEO, digital marketing, PPC, drop shipping, etc, so I have all the skills necessary to really make some profit off of these projects.

Going to try and use this subreddit as a way to keep myself motivated, sharing updates about progress, ideas I have, things that aren't working, and more.

Even when I was on a longer break from making niche sites over the last few years I'd always come here to read posts and case studies and income updates. Sad to see Google has wrecked so many people's income streams and motivation that the sub is hardly even used anymore."
6,"Seeking Feedback on Approaching Leadership as an Overqualified, Underutilized Employee",sysadmin,skate-and-code,0,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1lt9p2m/seeking_feedback_on_approaching_leadership_as_an/,"I am seeking feedback on how to approach leadership regarding my current predicament as an overqualified and underutilized employee at a non-profit organization. The title may come off as uppity, but I hope the provided context lends some propriety. Ultimately, I'm looking for guidance on how best to voice my concerns to upper management.

I joined my first IT position as a help desk specialist approximately 13 years ago. Unfortunately, the way IT was managed then was woefully misguided, but as a newcomer, I didn't know any better and did what I was told. Over time, I managed to adapt and broaden my skill set in various roles and at different companies, but life events (personal changes and layoffs) led me back to the same organization where leadership remained unchanged.

Despite some improvements since my last visit, such as a competent MSP managing infrastructure and call-in support and an intelligent IT manager without decision-making authority, I find myself stuck in a rut when it comes to executing initiatives due to a lack of an IT advocate with authority. The IT manager, the MSP, and I have numerous initiatives we want to pursue, but without an IT stakeholder involved in decisions, progress is non-existent.

One (latest) example of this problem is the implementation of FoxIt to solve e-signature issues. Without involving IT in discussions about current workflows, problems to be solved, or gathering feedback, leadership made a decision that has already resulted in limitations with licensing options and the need for an upgrade just weeks after deployment. The obvious solution is upgrading the license, but instead of accepting this recommendation, my IT manager's boss asked me to find a workaround for their problem. I politely declined because adding another complexity on top of a new solution isn't the best path forward.

What frustrates me is that leadership asks for workarounds after knowing there was a licensing issue, seemingly pushing their mistake off onto me. Despite my intentions to leave as soon as I find a better opportunity, I feel obligated to confront upper management and provide them with feedback in hopes of gaining some relevance in the decisions being made.

I appreciate your time and any feedback you can provide on what might be missing or needs clarification. Thank you!"
6,MSSP: Do we need a PSA?,msp,pakillo777,4,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1lrfi1h/mssp_do_we_need_a_psa/,"Hey there, we are an MSSP providing offsec services, consulting services, and managed security services.   
The first two are consulting based, and with their respective project management solutions and collaborative workplaces we have it pretty well figured out management-wise.  
  
However, in the managed services part, which we're growing very fast, we provide MDR, cloud backups, some Microsoft stuff, and other services.   
We are using an ERP for invoicing/accounting/billing, but the current workflow is to manually check the licenses usage on each client on their tenant on each app, and put them on the monthly invoice in the ERP. They sometimes vary month-to-month so they have to be checked and done manually every time.   
However, there are quite a few multi-tenant style services we are providing which have scattered dashboards and licensing, such as DNSFilter, DLP solutions, or the aforementioned MDR &amp; Cloud Backups.

While some of them get grouped and licensed via PAX8, others don't. As of now it's just  a couple/4 hours at the end of each month, including other accounting tasks, so it's not something to change immediately.

However, I do think this might get unsustainable in the near future with the current growth. 

Do we need a PSA? If so, which one is suggested? We plan on acquiring or building an MSP in the mid/long term, so if it's something compatible for both MSSPs and MSPs alike, it'd be great.

Thanks in advance!"
6,Alternative to Ubiquiti Unifi routers,msp,Juggling_DNS_Records,0,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1lql44b/alternative_to_ubiquiti_unifi_routers/,"Hello,

I am a small MSP and have a few networks running mostly Unifi. The switches and Wi-Fi AP's are great, but I am noticing some issues with their firewalls. We had to change something on-site but just couldn't get it to work while other routers (Miktrotik, Draytrek) worked perfectly. The last few weeks I came across some other weird behavior and decided to look for alternatives. It runs pretty good if it runs, but if there is an issue or want to make a 'big' change it's starting to be a challenge. Also, if it appears to be a bug good luck reporting it and have it fixed. Their router line up just seem unfinished and buggy to me.

What's the best alternative for Unifi routers in your opinion? I've did some searching for myself and found the Alta Lab router (Route10) but not sure if they have local management or not. Seems they are also managed through a controller. Would prefer to have both cloud management (centralized) and local management in case there's something wrong.

TIA :)"

6,"Stick with Microsoft, or Bail?",projectmanagement,HelixDoubled,14,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1lbljgv/stick_with_microsoft_or_bail/,"I've been slowly cornered into Microsoft and for the most part haven't minded it - mostly because a) I still freakin LOVE OneNote, and b) over the years MS has literally bought all my favourite software that I happened to be using (ex. Sunrise, Wunderlist, etc)

I've been using To Do/Planner/Project via Teams as my main driver work flow for all my (massive) business projects, everything from blogging to funding and management - so I need something scalable from minute tasks to large scale projects

My first biz has been Google Suite (or whatever its called) since day one, whereas my larger scale business will use MS - this is because I find Microsoft's backend still is wayyy better for scalable business goals &amp; overall feature set.

While I was at first excited for their effort to combine To Do, Planner &amp; Project, it has been clearly... lacking.

So before I re-subscribe to a more costly tier of MS Project which was on hold for personal reasons, before I dive fully back into the MS ecosystem I'm wondering what other solutions exist so I'm not totally locked in and also want to be sure what meets MY needs best:

Essentially, I've always gone with what best suites my needs totally disregarding any bias - MS has frequently met my needs better since I'm more of an advanced user - but that said, I dont want to be absolutely dependant - especially since MS seems... unreliable these days.

**TLDR;**

I'm considering all-in-one task managers to project management solutions (ie rather than several different apps) 

**Needs:**

Scalable - from small tasks due here &amp; now example:

1 quick ""widget"" etry of small impromptu tasks which may be due here &amp; now  
2. Or these tasks can get grouped into Task Lists (such as ""Networking, or Blog Ideas)  
3. These lists may become future oriented, so Kanban's become more appropriate  
4. Then some are longer term so Gantt/Timeline/Roadmaps 

Accessible &amp; Future Proof

\- Accessible for my staff, and generally should still work within Teams - I dont want to shoehorn people into a clumsy out of date workflow  
\- This is all because I do not want to have a major software change later on in our venture so I'm trying to look ahead as well.

**So far I've narrowed it down to:**

a) Continue using MS Planner/Project/Teams (I still may choose this despite its shortcomings, esp since I use a Samsung phone so there's also ease of use there)

b) [Monday.com](http://Monday.com)

c) Notion

d) ClickUp

e) Open to other suggestions!

We want a program that will handle the whole funnel so we don't have to be working with a bunch of different services. Client is just starting out so only has 320 contacts, but figures she could be over 1,500 in a couple of months. So we want the functionality of:

  
Landing pages

Contact forms

CRM

Good email deliverability 

Automations (take leads along to deals and then to completed deals and then to past clients) 

WhatsApp and possibly SMS integration 

Ability to segment contacts into leads and current clients (Students in this case) so we can stay in touch with current and former students differently from how we deal with leads. 

  
And of course my client is trying to do it on as low a budget as possible.  Brevo is $80/month Canadian for the features we're looking for, and that's a bit more than she wants to spend but it would be ok if was a really good service, but I've been scared off by the negative stuff I saw on here. 

I'm trying hard to convince her not to go with a bunch of different services (Kit, Hubspot) in order to save a $20/month as it will just cost a lot more in headaches and excess work in the long run.  But is there just no way to avoid going into $100+ per month to get a good service?

Even having an abulance come to your house will bill you thousands of dollar. Hospitals in the US also like to up bid everything- which makes the cost of everything healthcare related, way more expensive in the US, and if you dont have insurance, you have to pay it all out of your pocket while other countries get it for free.

5,How We Helped a 2 Man Creative Agency Add $9K in Monthly Profit Without Ads,Entrepreneur,Superb_Engineer9398,0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ltrv1l/how_we_helped_a_2_man_creative_agency_add_9k_in/,"Most early stage agency owners think scaling means adding more, doing more, always more more more. 

But in my experience, the biggest profit jumps come from simplifying and focus, not stacking.

Here’s what we did:

We worked with a 2 person creative agency doing about $5K in monthly profit. They do great work, they were booked out but still not making the money they wanted. They thought they needed to run ads or build a cold outreach machine to grow.

Instead, we focused on what was already working. Here’s what we changed:

**1. Streamlined Their Offer**

They had tiers of service and were customizing everything. We consolidated into one simple, outcome based package that most of their customers were buying anyway. This meant faster sales, and easier execution.

**2. Added a Light Retainer Model**

They were doing great with one off projects but had nearly 0 repeat revenue. We added a basic maintenance and consulting offer after each project. About 40% of clients took it and they added $3K/month just from that.

**3. Cut Low Margin Clients**

They were spending the same amount of time on $1,200 projects as on $4,000 ones. We quietly stopped offering the low end work and they started making more money doing less.

No ads. No extra sales calls. No crazy new software.

Just business model cleanup and more clarity on where their time and profit was actually going.

Within 6 weeks, their profit grew from $5K to just over $14K and they were starting to make the kind of money they have been wanting, and they are still growing.

Not here to pitch anything. Just sharing what I’m seeing with agencies and professional service firms.

I’m curious, whats one “low key” shift your made that had the biggest impact to your bottom line?

5,Stop chasing AI and fix your broken processes first.,business,NewNefariousness8325,23,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1lqszyt/stop_chasing_ai_and_fix_your_broken_processes/,"I’ve worked with multiple early-stage companies that rushed to adopt “AI tools” to speed up their workflows.

But what actually slowed them down? 
• No standardized invoice approval process  
• Expenses routed through Slack messages  
• Vendor tracking in 5 different spreadsheets  
• No ownership over who approves what

Some companies do not recognise that their tools weren’t the problem their process was. AI can’t fix disorganized teams. It can only accelerate the chaos if your foundation is messy.

What’s one process you fixed before you automated it? Or… did you automate before fixing? I am curious how other startups tackled this."
5,"Early Growth 101 for LinkedIn, X, and Reddit - i will not promote",startups,TheOneirophage,5,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1lttcbl/early_growth_101_for_linkedin_x_and_reddit_i_will/,"I spent weeks researching how to grow my own business' (B2B SaaS) user base, and am sharing what I learned about content marketing on LinkedIn, X, and Reddit.  This is based on case studies and playbooks I've found, including those written by the teams at TweetHunter (X experts) and Popsy (Reddit experts).  There are five universal steps to be taken on each platform:

**1. Optimize Your Profile**

* Clearly describe who you are, your product, and its value to specific audiences.
* Ensure professional branding: use polished banners, profile pictures, and icons.
* Include links to your website and social channels.
* Pin a high-impact post introducing your product or yourself.
* Consider duplicating this effort with a company account for added organic visibility.

  
**2. Gain Audience Access**

* **Twitter:** Regularly reply to influential users in your niche, building visibility and follower count. Get to 3000 followers before you spend effort creating high quality content.
* **LinkedIn:** Send connection invites to active users engaging with your niche; manage stale invites actively. The current limit is 5000 open invites and 30000 connections, use it.
* **Reddit:** Earn karma through meaningful contributions. Maintain an 8:1 ratio of valuable content to self-promotion. Be aware of the specific rules of each sub.
* **Universal Tip:** Engage actively during peak usage hours (usually mid-morning weekdays).

  
**3. Customize Successful Posts**

* Analyze top-performing posts in your niche using tools like TweetHunter or Postmaster.
* Identify and emulate proven formats and themes, personalizing them to your story and product.
* Recreate successful structures and adjust them to your own insights and experiences.

  
**4. Schedule Posts at Optimal Times**

* Understand when your audience is most active: typically weekday mornings (Tuesday-Thursday) for Twitter and LinkedIn; early mornings for Reddit.
* Use scheduling tools like TweetHunter, Hypefury, Buffer, or Postpone to automate your posting.
* Regularly review analytics to optimize timing based on real engagement data.

  
**5. Engage through Replies and Likes**

* Always reply promptly to comments on your posts to foster conversations and boost visibility.
* Actively like and respond to engagement, keeping interactions authentic and human.
* Encourage colleagues, friends, and team members to engage with your posts, especially within the first critical hour after posting.
* Utilize daily internal updates to boost engagement organically (e.g., Slack links to key posts).

  
If anyone has additional tips and tricks, I would love it if folks shared them.  We all get better at our work when we share what we know!

5,What job market am I in?,marketing,beatbox69,17,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1lrs1ub/what_job_market_am_i_in/,"I used to own and run a marketing agency, but after it folded, largely because it just wasn’t working with my partners (one of whom abandoned the business and barely turned up to work) I started looking after a film and animation studio team. I then moved into a business development role and brought more business to the new studio. After that, I spent a year as Group Marketing Manager at a company with 250 staff and a turnover of around £100 million a year.

I also run a few media channels in my spare time. Most months I earn some consultancy money by helping small businesses with workflow problems, auditing and then creating low-cost roadmaps for their marketing. I sell some art, and I have a history series and a cooking show coming out soon. I am a conversation curator for adults with learning difficulties and make theatre productions with them.  I like to keep busy, and I suspect I’m somewhere on the spectrum.

This isn’t really about me, it’s about the number of roles I’ve applied for and heard nothing back from. Some of these roles would mean taking a pay cut because they sounded really interesting,  and still nothing.

Is anyone else out there reasonably experienced but still not getting replies or being offered interviews for lower-paid roles.

I've been looking for really niche roles, creative producer for podcasts, Marketing Manager at large manufacturing family run businesses. A business development officer for my local town for supporting small businesses. And didn't get replies from some. 

I need help to understand this.

Having now visited 6 of these countries at some point in my life, I would make this my ranking in 2025:

1) Vietnam

2) Thailand

3) Malaysia

4) Philippines (sucks that you can only be in Cebu or Manila to get reliable internet)

5) Indonesia

6) Cambodia

7) Singapore (too expensive, obviously)

8) Don't know much about the others

Vietnam and Thailand are in a tier of their own compared to the others. I have to give Vietnam the edge right now because price inflation has affected Thailand a lot over the last 5 years while Vietnam has remained very cheap. I also find the locals to seem happier in Saigon and Hanoi versus Bangkok and the surrounding areas.

The ranking of the Philippines will probably cause the most controversy. I understand that many subs, including this one sometimes, loves to hate on PH. I find it perfect to live in for a month or two. Great Airbnb options as well in the cities."
5,my Next.js boilerplate made 34 sales and $2600+ in 15 days,SaaS,crololocro,21,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1lu3614/my_nextjs_boilerplate_made_34_sales_and_2600_in/,"I always chose Next.js, Supabase, Shadcn UI, and Stripe for my projects. I supported open source whenever I could and tried to use OSS tools as much as possible. But almost every time, I ran into bloated codebases filled with features I didn’t need. Nothing worked out of the box. I had to rewrite more than 80% of the code just to make it fit my needs. Even duplicating my own launched projects required heavy rewrites.

I also tried a few paid starter kits. But they came with overly complex integrations, unfamiliar stacks, and constant bugs.

So I decided to build my own boilerplate, [NeoSaaS](https://neosaas.dev).

Anyone who ships regularly knows how mentally and physically draining it is to fight with boilerplate code every single time just to get started. NeoSaaS is built with the modern stack most indie makers already use: Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind, Shadcn UI, Google Analytics (or Datafast), and Stripe.

NeoSaaS works like this:

1. Add your environment variables
2. Run the SQL on Supabase
3. You’re ready to ship

That’s all. No unnecessary dependencies. No overly opinionated structure. No tech stack you’ve never touched before.

After 15 days, I got 34 sales with early adopter pricing. (If anyone need proof I can send).

More importantly, I received thoughtful feedback from people who actually used the product. People who bought it, or even just tried the demo, reached out with genuine support.

A little about me for context:

* Founder of 5 products in edtech, productivity, and martech
* Scaled all of them to 1M+ users
* Two times VC-raised, three times bootstrapped
* Been doing this for 10+ years, tried pretty much every imaginable growth channel

These aren’t random tools I tried once, they are part of my real stack:

* Loops.so ($50/mo or free if you’ve got under 1,000 subs) — Super clean, dead simple for both email marketing and transactional emails. Love how easy it is.
* Hunter.io ($25/mo) — Been using this one for years. Hands down my go-to for lead gen and outreach.
* Canva Pro ($15/mo) — We use Canva for anything design, easy and fast.
* Foreplay.co ($59/mo) or Magritte.co (free) — Both are solid for ad inspiration if you run paid ads. Foreplay gives you a massive scraped library; Magritte is curated, cleaner, and easier to search. Can’t recommend them enough. 
* ChatGPT ($20/mo) — Daily use for me. Drafting copy, brainstorming ideas, rewriting headlines, summarizing content, it’s like a creative partner that doesn’t sleep.
* TinyPNG (Free) — Quick and easy image compression. Keeps everything fast-loading without losing quality.
* LinkedIn (69/mo) — Beyond posting, we use it for manual, highly targeted outreach. Still one of the best B2B tools if you know how to use it.
* Notes (Free) — I’ve tried all the productivity tools. Ended up back on Notes for managing to-dos, prompts, random ideas, lists, etc.
* Screen Studio ($229 one-time) — The cleanest, smoothest way to make product demo videos. Looks pro with minimal effort.

Curious what other founders are using daily. What’s in your stack?"

5,How to land your dream job without applying at 400 companies. [Discussion],GetMotivated,hrguyinSC,0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1ltfyfb/how_to_land_your_dream_job_without_applying_at/,"How to land your dream job without applying at 400 companies. 

99% of people won’t be willing to do this. That means if you do, you will stand out from the rest. 

What makes me qualified to share? 

I have interviewed more than 10k people, hired more than 1,000, and sold more than $60M in new business. You’ll see why the sales matters in a minute. 

I see a lot of posts that say things like “I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs” or “I keep interviewing and can’t get an offer”. 

Most of the people writing these posts don’t have a sales background. 

Having sales experience is extremely helpful to a jobseeker. 

Sales professionals know it is better to put together a targeted campaign focused on your buyer persona than to sell to anyone and everyone. 

🚨 Follow these steps to stand out from the crowd: 🚨

1. Top Target List: Instead of “spraying and praying” (applying to hundreds or thousands of jobs), create your top target list. Ideally this is in the 25-50 range. 

You should know what role, what size company, and what geography you are targeting. Create a list in a spreadsheet. 

2. Profiling: Instead of just being another applicant in the ATS, you can do research on your dream companies to find the following:

- hiring manager for your role
- what they care about
- direct contact information

Most of this can be done through LinkedIn and Hunter.io.

3. Create a Campaign: Now you can create a targeted outbound campaign. 

What could a campaign look like?

First, and most importantly, it should be multi-touch and multi-channel. 

Example:

- First touch - handwritten letter
- Second touch - LinkedIn connection
- Third touch - email
- Fourth touch - LinkedIn message
- Fifth touch - phone call

Personally, I would go further but this is a heck of a start. 

There is a zero percent chance the person will not know who you are by the end of this. 

Make sure you create custom messaging that resonates with the leader and puts their needs first. 

4. Execute. 

Some people will say this is annoying. Great. Good for them. They won’t hire you. 

But…

👉Someone will see your initiative. 👉Someone will notice how much further you were willing to go than the other applicants. 
👉You will get a shot. 

💡And guess what? 

It will take the same amount of time as applying to hundreds of jobs. 

5. Interviews: Now it’s time to stand out in person. 

First off;

👏 Show. Up. Prepared. 

- Do your research on the company. 
- Research the person interviewing you. 
- Practice your responses to the most common interview questions. 
- Create a “brag book” and bring it with you. Achievements, metrics, proof that you can do the job. 
- Follow up with a handwritten thank you note. 

🏆 If you do these things, you will be ahead of 99% of applicants. 

If you want to be different, be different. 

Follow these steps. I guarantee you will create more opportunities than spraying and praying.

5,I don't know where to begin investing into my site,juststart,hikekorea,14,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1jfix8z/i_dont_know_where_to_begin_investing_into_my_site/,"I've been blogging for over a decade and in the last 4-5 years have made a small amount of money.  I still work fulltime and recently started a family and am looking at investing what I've made back into the site.  But here's the problem. I have no idea how to go about hiring someone, what ""job"" I'm even looking for, and have had trust issues with fiverrr work in the past

I probably need to just get over the trust issues.  But even then I still don't really know what to do.  I've done everything for my site but had no formal training in most of it.  Writing, editing, photography, seo, wordpress, webhosting, etc... my site feels more like a Frankenstein website that is running by sheer willpower.

I'm sure I have optimizing that I'm not aware of; I know I have emails leading to digital sponsorships, I've done alright with affiliates etc. and think all of these are jobs I could hire out.  But I don't know if I just write a bunch of small gigs on something like fiverr for email answering, various SEO work, keyword research and optimizing, etc.  Or am I looking for a single person, maybe an assistant editor that I pay part-time for XX hours per week?

I have some other ideas for hiring a social media person or an editor to help me publish a book and have a physical item to sell which feels should happen before I spend any $$$ on marketing

I get a few dozen contacts for some kind of collaboration most months.  It takes more time to email back and forth coming to an agreement than actually doing the ""work"" on the site.  I feel like this is proof of profitability to me and I could streamline my end by hiring someone to help make the deals.

But what does that mean?  Do I go on fiverr again?  Do I need to come up with an hourly work flow and make a part time posting somewhere like Indeed?

  
Sorry if this ended up rambling or totally in the wrong sub.  I just know that a little extra help and expertise right now would go a long way and have the cash to hire someone right now."
5,A list of tools and marketing channels to help grow your website,juststart,craftythedog,31,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1gvoiep/a_list_of_tools_and_marketing_channels_to_help/,"In my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blogging/comments/1go0hxo/a_list_of_traffic_sources_to_help_grow_your_blog/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) on r/blogging, I created a list of traffic sources for growing a blog. That post received a lot of comments and feedback from other bloggers.

I wanted to add more value to that list based on the feedback, so I created an updated list of tools and marketing channels to grow your website- whether it be a blog, a SaaS, an e-commerce store, or whatever kind of website you have.

|Platform|Comments|
|:-|:-|
|Bluesky|Bsky is crazy- unlike X, which took me months to get anywhere. On Bsky, the audience seemed really into the content that was being posted. I saw accounts with interests similar to the website's niche, so I followed and clicked through the link to the site. It's super motivating to see!|
|Interactivity Studio|Super cool free marketing tool- I've noticed an increase in conversions and click-throughs when I embed interactive images of affiliate products on my site. The interactivity also helped decrease bounce rates for traffic coming from Pinterest. And yes, I post on the community to get more traffic from Interactivity Studio and add a link to my blog for a backlink. On one of my sites, I embedded a map with different regions linked to different pages. Worked much better to get my audience to check out more pages on my site.|
|Unsplash|Yes, you heard me right- Unsplash. If you are in a visual niche and are taking original photos, posting them on Unsplash can be a goldmine- especially if you are running an agency type of business or a digital marketing type of business. Whenever someone downloads your photo, there is a chance they might give you attribution, which can improve your brand/ website visibility. I have tried the same with other stock image platforms too but Unsplash has shown the best results so far.|
|Peerlist|At first I thought this was some wannabe Product Hunt, but then they did a feature launch of Peerlist articles. Even though most of the audience is into tech, I found that posting articles here works great for parasite SEO. If you are targeting low keyword difficulty keywords, you can rank much faster through Peerlist as articles get indexed relatively fast. Also, if you post on the weekly launchpad, you get a do-follow backlink.|
|Dailymotion|Who here still remembers Dailymotion? At one point, they were actually bigger than YouTube. I have crossposted some of the long-form video content from my YouTube channel to Dailymotion. Surprisingly seeing similar results in terms of views here since the videos are also getting indexed in SERP.|
|Threads|It was a smooth transition setting up Threads since I already had an Instagram account with 100+ followers. I started to see some engagement when I posted links to my site. However, I shifted gears to see what people were searching for and what my competitors were not focusing on and created content accordingly. This helped grow my threads account and get more traffic to my site.|
|Framer Plugins|This one is for the devs. Framer recently announced the launch of Framer Plugins. Much like WordPress plugins, this opens doors to multiple possibilities- especially if you are running a SaaS business. There are only 54 plugins as of the writing of this post, so your chances to get noticed and acquire new users is high- unlike WordPress, which literally has thousands of plugins.|
|Webview Apps|I had a tool site that was in a high-competition niche. I got someone on Fiverr to turn my site into an Android app and published it to the Play Store. Since then, the app received more than 50,000 installs and has been a reliable source of traffic for me.|
|Uneed(dot)best|This platform has come a long way since its launch. They're getting some serious traffic, and every tool/ website that you submit here gets featured which was a big w. The only downside is that if you don't make it to the top 3 upvoted products for the day, you don't get a do-follow backlink. But if you do, it'll send traffic to your website forever.|
|Gumroad|If you are looking to grow your email list, or to create an additional source of revenue for your website, I found Gumroad to be quite effective. I created a downloadable digital product and listed it on Gumroad for free. Then I put a link on my site for users to get the 'Free Guide'. Built an email list from 0-100 in a matter of 1 month  through this method. I found this to work far better than the Grow plugin I had mentioned in my post earlier.|
|Flipboard|Before they changed the algorithm, things were going pretty well and I was seeing a decent number of outbound clicks. But now I am not sure anymore. I am a/b testing things to see what works and plant to double down on what actually does, but in the meantime, I still think that original content tends to do much better here.|
|Google Classroom|If you are in the education niche, it might feel more native for your users to join your space in a Google Classroom. Once you build an audience here, you can add links to your content and drive targeted traffic to your website. If you are not in the education niche, telegram or WhatsApp are good places to build your audience.|
|Slideshare|If the nature of your website involves documents, slideshows, etc, then posting them on Slideshare can be another great avenue to get more eyeballs on your content and website. I prefer Slideshare over Scribd or Issuu since the user experience is much nicher imo, but you can post on similar document-sharing platforms too.|

I have intentionally skipped some other popular platforms since there is plenty of information and strategies covering them, but just in case, here is a brief list:

* Pinterest
* Facebook pages &amp; groups
* Website directories
* Email
* YouTube
* Medium
* PPC campaign
* Micro-influencer marketing

Of course, not all items in this list might apply to you, but for the ones that do, you can pick and choose to alter your growth strategies!

P.S. I have started a newsletter (link in my profile). This will be a space where I will share my strategies for growing my websites and snippets along my journey. Feel free to tag along!"

Downsides of being a solo operator is when things get hectic in life, there will be a lot less time to spend projects. Missed last few update with day job going cray, but I'm back with a brief overview of June, July and August - it'll be a longer one, so pour yourself a cuppa, slippers on and get comfy.

Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month (altho now little bit less frequent) I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on.

While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/juststart might benefit from the site, especially those looking to start an online project on the side.

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.

# General Observations

**an Update a day keeps your traffic away**

Last time I was discussing the impact of the Google Core Update - March edition, and that it's finally hit DA as well.

Over April and May, it was just a continuation, with Google Search traffic going down, with the site taking around 40% hit on traffic, and lost around 35% of keywords (from its peak) that the site was previously ranking for.

The good news is that over June, July and first half of August I've seen a recovery, back to similar numbers as at the start of the year, with August actually eclipsing those numbers.

The bad news is that there was another Google Core Update - August edition, that's already showing a negative impact on Google Search traffic, I guess it's time to brace myself for impact, again.

**on Showing up in search results**

On the other hand, for the last 2 months, [DataAnalyst.com](http://DataAnalyst.com) has consistently showed up in the Top 3 search results for the ""data analyst jobs"" keyword in the United States. At some point it was even ranking n.1 (yes, I've made screenshots)

I take that as a big win - with virtually $0 spend on content (my only expense is the tech platform), I'm pretty happy to see the site showing up so high in the results, means that something had to be done right.

With all that, were still able to cross an all time high in terms of unique visitors, still contribute to almost 28,000 job applications made, and still grow our newsletter subscriber base.

**So, where are people coming from?**

Organic search - 53%

Direct - 37%

Social - 6%

Other - 4%

Overall, I expected to see a summer slump, which didn't really materialise, so it's nice to see month on month growth.

**An additional learning on running a Newsletter** - since I took pause with the newsletter over the summer, I was quite excited to get the next edition of the newsletter out. What I didn't really foresee is that going couple of months without sending it, would have a trickle down effect on the deliverability, almost as if it was throttled to prevent spam abuse.

If you haven't received this month's edition, I apologise, and I'll figure out a way to get it over to you.

**On Monetization**

I decided to start offering an exclusive partnership with a sponsor, that wouldn't be a detriment to on site experience.

It would be one highlighted sponsor per month, on the whole site + newsletter - this could command a much higher fee, and would expand potential clients, from only employers, to education providers, analytics tools etc looking to target analysts.

The added benefit is the network of both DataAnalyst.com AND BusinessAnalyst.com, where for the time being I can offer same BusinessAnalyst placement as part of the package.

With that in mind, I've downloaded a dump of all companies/orgs paying for Google Ads, over the last 12 months.

Particularly targeting same keywords that I can offer them direct audience to, through the site. (i.e Data Analyst / Data Analytics + courses, certificate, tools, bootcamps etc - I'm not going for all the long-tails for now, just the key subset)

Just over the last 8 months, that makes around 120 organisations (ranging from educational institutes, startups offering data analytics tools, to bootcamps and career tools providers) who target some of these specific keywords, and have actively spend on getting those ads up in search results.

That's the next job for me, to do an active outreach and see where it makes the most sense to go from here. This is something that I wanted to do over the summer, but day-job and additional responsibilities got int he way.

**In the meantime, I did already agree one sponsorship / partnership, which is planned for early next year.**

It's time to start building out that calendar.

**On Content**

I'm consistently thinking how I can add more valuable content on the site - not just on salary trends, or interviews, but also around education.

**After-all, career growth and education go hand in hand.**

There are of course cases where people were able to find a data analyst job without a formal degree, I think it would be very fair to say that in today's cutthroat challenging job environment, having formal qualification is a must have.

Whether it is for an entry level role, or for people who are looking to transition from their exiting role within an organisation (although in those cases, having a network and trust of colleagues around forms a big part of the equation).

With that in mind, what's coming in the next couple of weeks or so, is an **Educational Directory.**

**Simply put, a directory of all (or close to all) Data Analytics degrees in the United States.**

It will be structured around the degree award

* Associate
* Bachelor's
* Master's

and also will be browsable by states, on campus/online curriculum.

I hope that people will find this directory useful, as you'll be able to see all the degrees in one place, with links to curriculum as well as financial considerations.

There is also an angle where I'd like to use this directory to reestablish contact with Educational Institutions, establish partnerships and have both sites listed in their directories - to the benefit of both students, and sites' authority.

**On The Salary Guide H1 2024 update**

With approximately 2,200+ data analyst jobs listed on the site up to this date, we analyze data to develop data analyst salary guide.  

**The Salary Guide has now been updated and published to include data for H1 2024.**

You can find the data analyst salary breakdown, by these areas:

Industry

* breakdown by specific industry, overall minimum, maximum, median and average salary + salary breakdown by years of experience

Years of experience

* breakdown of all jobs on the site by years of experience
* entry level (0 - 3 years), senior (3 - 5 years), lead (5+ years)

State

* this is where it gets tricky. Now, as it usually is with this kind of exercise, lumping the data all together you come up with an insane range.  

On the other hand, if you split the data in 52 different ways, you'll get a whole different set of issues where N is not large enough to draw any conclusions - and for some states, there's simply no data at all (not to single any state out, but I'm looking at you, Wyoming).

Company view

* on each company page, we include average data analyst salaries at all the companies that are listed on the site.

As the site grows, and the number of jobs on the site increases, I believe that I'll be able to bring an addition source of information about salaries, complimenting those already available on other sites.

# Day in a life of a Data Analyst, with Joe and Arun

Another two interviews from our series has been published earlier this week. In these interviews, we aim to share stories and experiences about the route to becoming a data analyst, keeping up with the skillset, recommendations to aspiring data analysts and much more.

**Joe is now the Director of Analytics and Data Science at UPMC, and Arun is a Senior Data Scientist at Fulcrum Digital.**

Firstly, thank you Joe, and Arun for your time, and sharing your experience, your journey, thoughts and advice with our readers, about growing one's career in the data analytics space.

We also touch on the Question of the Year: How does AI impact the Data Analyst role?

Make sure you read both interviews on the blog, they are absolutely worth it.

And now, let's jump in.

**After starting his career in nursing, Joe is now the Director of Analytics and Data Science at UPMC's Heart and Vascular Institute**

Speaking with Joe, we got to talk about his extensive experience - and to be honest, I really can't properly cover in a few paragraphs here.

So, let me provide a few bulletpoints that Joe covers:

* self-education to improve patient outcomes
* the importance of networking, seizing opportunities, and luck
* how the role will change as your career progresses
* what makes him excited about the healthcare sector right now

And two of my favourite highlights from our conversation (on using data to drive business decisions, and on leadership):

**On using data to drive business decisions:**

*""The insights are easy, it’s getting them to drive business decisions that is difficult. What you truly need to get people to act on insights is trust.*

*Trust takes a while to develop but some ways to establish early trust are the following:*

1. *Get quick wins in a new position.*

*Do this by finding the low hanging fruit and knocking those projects off the to do list*

*2) Overdeliver.*

*In other words, be as fast as you can with turning projects around*

*3) Communicate.*

*Initially, don’t worry about overcommunicating (yes, you can overcommunicate), but when you are new to a role, be sure to keep people updated and ask as many questions as you need.""*

***On leadership:***

*""Being a leader requires a very different skillset to what's required from individual contributors, and early in one's career.*

*Everyone can be a leader, it doesn’t matter what your formal title is.*

*I started studying leadership in an individual contributor (IC) role, 3 years before I got a formal managerial role.*

*I did this through reading, listening to podcasts, and then applying those concepts and ideas to my daily life in both work and home.*

*So, it’s important to realize that leadership is something everyone can do in any role.*

*Making that mindset shift makes being able to jump from a technical IC to a managerial role much easier because it is much more important to lead than to manage.*

*Managing, in my view, are the actions associated with formal procedure in an organization, typically related to human resources. These are standard and mostly check boxes and are easily navigated if one has developed an ability to lead.*

*I will say, leadership is a constant teacher. You must be willing to be humble and learn from when you make mistakes to get better at it.""*

**How Arun went from LinkedIn networking, a data analytics internship at eBay, to a career shift into a senior data scientist role at Fulcrum Digital**

**On how his data analytics role equipped him to be a better data scientist**

*""All data roles in general are partners of the business.*

*There is a lot of emphasis on being aligned with the business teams and strongly supporting them.*

*As a data scientist there is a lot of emphasis on building predictive models which involves doing Exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, building machine learning/AI models, model evaluation, deployment and maintenance.*

*But the key to all of these things is making sure the problem statement and the goal is understood along with ensuring the data cleaning and preparation are done in the best possible manner.*

*So being an experienced data analyst helped me in the areas of SQL, building visualizations using tools like Tableau, DOMO and also having strong connections with the business stakeholders and to deliver valuable timely insights which helped me be a well-rounded data scientist.""*

**On a data analyst role in different types organisations:**

*""There are two types of career paths in the field of data:*

1. *Working for consulting companies like Mu sigma, Fractal, EXL, McKinsey etc.*
2. *Working directly for product companies such as TESCO, Meta, Unilever, Pepsico, Google etc.*

*Choosing either of the two depends on what kind of career paths that you want to pursue as both provide different kinds of career paths.*

*Consulting provides exposure to a variety of analytics projects across domains and industries while working with Product companies helps you gain a lot of knowledge about the product and grow well too.""*

As I've mentioned before, I launched [BusinessAnalyst.com](http://BusinessAnalyst.com) - where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infrastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (after-all, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa).

Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any consistent revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck.

Both Data Analyst and Business Analyst roles share a lot of similarities. So if you are looking for role that gives you exposure to data, going the Business Analyst route could also provide an opportunity to gain experience, and improve your data analytics skillset, albeit it would be a smaller part of your role. It's something that you can build on in the future, and use as a stepping stone in your pursuit toward a data analyst career.

# General Observations:

After the very slow start, the site is continuing its organic growth (albeit at a glacial pace).

My main ""beef"" with the site, is simply how drastically different Google behavior is, when comparing to DataAnalyst.com.

DA indexed pages: 4,600 / 5,000 total BA indexed pages: 1,700 / 4,000 total

DA indexed jobs: 1,600 / 2,200 total BA indexed jobs: 123 / 1,600 total (WTF?)

DA ranked keywords: 6,100 BA ranked keywords: 9 (WTF squared)

I'm using same on-page SEO, same off-page SEO, same metadata structure, same job schema structure, using the same indexing tools, and yet, results are night and day.

I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

**Content:**

I've naturally progressed with the content on the site, recently also adding a comprehensive business analyst salary guide.

As mentioned above, there's now a whole structure around Educational content - Universities offering Associate, Bachelor's and Master's business analytics degrees.

A case could certainly be made that one can start in in business analyst career from pretty much most business related degrees, but at least for these experimental purposes, I've made the call to focus on Business Analytics (as the analytics part would enable people to broaden their skillset)

# Things in the pipeline

* New data analyst jobs, added daily
* Figuring out what to do with the newsletter
* Monthly US data analyst market insights
* Improving the overall site experience (this one is a never ending activity)
* Continuing to bring you Data Analysts across their experience levels, to share tips, tricks and their thoughts

5,My first web: Month 1,juststart,Glad-Banana-9267,24,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1bkvmd5/my_first_web_month_1/,"I wrote **6** articles \[ :(((( \] and received

**258 impressions with three clicks**.



Initially, I didn't plan to make a post, but I said I will in previous one. I aimed to follow u/PhilReddit7, but ended up writing six pages instead. Hopefully, I'll manage 30 next month...

**What has this month been like for me?**

When I wrote my first page, I didn't check the keyword difficulty KD or SERP. Although I'm getting impressions for that page, I'm not getting any clicks. When I eventually checked the KD, it was around 80, with a good SERP. I'm glad I didn't stick with strategy of not checking anything.

For my second-page keywords, I did some research, and all three of my clicks are from that page. The SERP, in my opinion, didn't show any good matches for the keyword; there were only a few questions answered on forums. What confuses me is that I'm not entirely sure which keywords I'm ranking for. When I select my second page in GSC under ""performance"" in the USA, the ""average position"" bar shows some positions at 1 for keywords much harder than the ones I aim to rank for. However, the keywords I've optimized in the title, H1, and description have positions lower than 30. When I search for the keywords ranking at position 1 in the USA, my page doesn't appear. I'm confused and must read more to understand this better.

Also, after March 8th, I didn't receive any clicks. Impressions from the page with three clicks have increased, and the position now confuses me. However, manually checking on Google Search shows the same results for several countries for the given keywords.

**What was causing me depression and patience was the solution**

1. When I added my third page great content, I believed it could be successful and was really excited. It got indexed immediately, as all my pages do (I request indexing in GSC). However, it didn't appear in the SERP for ten days, nor did it show up in the ""performance"" section. No need to say, I checked every day if it was there. Eventually, the page showed up, but 10 days felt like a long time. I discovered that good interlinking - not just through the navigation bar, but also when other pages link to the one I'm about to add - speeds up its appearance on the SERP, like within three days.
2. Additionally, I added a favicon, and it immediately showed up in the tab, but once again, it didn't appear in the SERP for about twelve days.

**Discouraging posts**  
Discouraging posts claiming SEO doesn't work ))......I want to see for myself, so I'll continue.

5,My newsletter was mentioned in front of 150k people. Tips for growing through collabs.,juststart,Party_Major5753,17,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1bhwuj7/my_newsletter_was_mentioned_in_front_of_150k/,"Hey everyone! 

I just wanted to share a quick update on my journey with starting a newsletter business. About a month and a half ago, I took the leap and launched my own newsletter, and the response has been positive so far!  
  
In such a short time, I've had the opportunity to collaborate with two amazing content creators. By making myself known and putting in the hours researching and writing, I managed to amass a solid following. This following was significant enough to catch the attention of micro to medium-sized content creators. It took everything I had just to write that cold DM, especially considering they were much bigger than me. However, I still reached out, and eventually, I secured the cross-promotion.  
  
I don't expect you to follow my advice, but if you want to take it into consideration, feel free to:

1. **Target micro influencers:** In the beginning, focus on connecting with micro influencers. Don't be scared to reach out to them; they are just as eager to grow their audience as you are.  

2. **Be honest about your following:** Never lie about your following. If you don't feel comfortable sharing that information, try to avoid the question, but always maintain honesty in your interactions.  

3. **Value is key:** Keep value as the main conversation topic when reaching out to collaborate. Explain how both content creators and their audiences can benefit from the collaboration. Highlight the mutual value exchange to encourage partnerships.  

4. **Don't be intimidated by subscriber count:** It's okay if the influencers you reach out to have a much larger following than you. Remember, the quality of subscribers also counts. For example, the first influencer I worked with had close to 70k followers on Instagram, while I had only hundreds. However, we managed to send each other almost the same amount of followers. Focus on the engagement and relevance of your audience rather than sheer numbers.
5. **Build genuine relationships:** When reaching out to potential collaborators, focus on building genuine relationships rather than just seeking transactions. Invest time in getting to know the content creators and their work. Building trust and rapport can lead to more meaningful and long-lasting partnerships. I still talk with Alex from time to time.
6. **Research audience compatibility:** Make sure your audiences are compatible!!! Ensuring compatibility between your audiences can lead to more successful collaborations and increased engagement with your content.

What is my newsletter about? Sending you entrepreneurship books every week, straight to your inbox. With all the key takeaways, favorite quotes, and actionable next steps, so you know how to apply each books concepts in real life. We also added a challenge every week, so you can focus on consuming more books in less time. 

For the sake of self-promotion, I'll share where to find my newsletter only if you ask for it in the comments. Hope it helps and hope these tips help you secure some cross-promotions and growth!

5,What are you recommending for AV in 2025?,sysadmin,juciydriver,31,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1lty2ld/what_are_you_recommending_for_av_in_2025/,"Hey all,

Pretty much what the subject asks...

I was using S1.  I've used Threatdown OneView (basically Malwarebytes) for the last year just to learn about it (mild review).  I've yet to try Huntress (my understanding is it's to be used in addition to an AV).  I'm currently using Guardz Cyber Security and considering switching back to S1 as they now offer integration with S1.

I'd love your feedback on what's just the best right now.

5,"What's the most bandaid-y setup you've done for a client, either permanent or temporary?",msp,HappyDadOfFourJesus,41,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1lpwugt/whats_the_most_bandaidy_setup_youve_done_for_a/,"I'll go first.  Recently we had a client's server running RAID 5 lose two drives within days of each other, which  required us to provision a temporary server, restore the VMs from cloud backup in sequence of urgency (PDC, Exchange, file server, &amp; LOB app).  The PDC was the quickest to restore over their 500Mbps connection because of size, Exchange came next and was successful, but the file server restore kept failing because of its multi TB size, so I paused the file server restore and moved onto the LOB app server, which was successful because it wasn't that large either.  

The plan was to come back to the file server restore after the LOB app server but one of our techs said that his old Dell Precision 3240 workstation with 32GB RAM that was just replaced a few weeks earlier might work temporarily, so I loaded a 4TB nVME SSD, installed Windows Server 2019 Standard, joined it to the client's domain, and started the cloud restore of the file server.  It took seven hours but worked remarkably.

So this Dell Precision 3240 compact workstation with using the onboard GigE NIC for the Hyper-V switch and a USB-to-Ethernet adapter for our management sat on top of our temporary server for over a week running their file server seamlessly and uninterrupted until the replacement SAS drives came in for their own server and the live migrations completed from our two ""servers"" back to their own server."

So I got fired without warning or anything.

My “manager” isn’t really my manager. In fact my contract doesn’t even say who I’ll be reporting to.

The “manager” didn’t do his job by telling me I was lacking in xyz area and instead went to the director of the company and basically complained saying I lack in xyz.

Then proceeds to ignore me for the following weeks when I ask him for help or clarification on what needs to be done.

I got fired because I was lacking in some areas. That’s fine but isn’t it my “managers” job to teach me or help me learn things instead of getting me fired?!

I need a job desperately, is there anyway anyone can help me out?

The Challenge

Small businesses lose leads due to delayed responses. Studies show 78% of customers buy from the company that responds first. But who can respond at 2 AM?

My Solution

https://preview.redd.it/k9a26ci0tabf1.png?width=1635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84930a206b3b65217997ed7c56f14a79f4b6061b

Engineered an automated system that:

* Instantly responds to WhatsApp inquiries
* Uses AI to understand intent and sentiment
* Scores leads from 1-10 based on buying signals
* Sends personalized responses
* Alerts sales team for high-value opportunities
* Maintains conversation history in CRM

Technical Architecture

Built with n8n (open-source), WhatsApp Web.js, DeepSeek AI, and Google Sheets integration. Containerized with Docker for easy deployment.

Real Results from Testing

Sample interaction:

* Customer: ""Need enterprise solution for 500 employees urgently""
* AI Analysis: Intent: Purchase, Sentiment: Positive, Score: 9/10
* Auto-Response: Personalized message addressing enterprise needs
* Action: Immediate notification to sales team

5,I built an AI automation that scrapes my competitor's product reviews and social media comments (n8n + MCP + AI) - Here's everything,automation,astronaut_611,33,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1lsspv8/i_built_an_ai_automation_that_scrapes_my/,"I've been a marketer for last 5 years, and for over an year I used to spend 9+ hrs/wk manually creating a report on my competitors and their SKUs. I had to scroll through hundreds of Amazon reviews and Instagram comments. It's slow, tedious, and you always miss things.

AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude can't do this, they hit a wall on protected pages. So, I built a fully automated system using n8n that can.

This agent can:

* Scrape reviews for any Amazon product and give a summarised version or complete text of the reviews.
* Analyse the comments on Instagram post to gauge sentiment.
* Track pricing data, scrape regional news, and a lot more.

This system now tracks over 500,000 data points across amazon pages and social accounts for my company, and it helped us improve our messaging on ad pages and amazon listings.

**The stack:**

* **Agent:** Self-hosted n8n instance on Render (I literally found the easiest way to set this up, I have covered it in the video below)
* **Scraping:** Bright Data's Web Unlocker API, which handles proxies, and CAPTCHAs. I connected it via a Smithery MCP server, which makes it dead simple to use.
* **AI Brain:** OpenAI GPT-4o mini, to understand requests and summarize the scraped data.
* **Data Storage:** A free Supabase project to store all the outputs.

As I mentioned before, I'm a marketer (turned founder) so all of it is built without writing any code

📺 **I created a video tutorial that shows you exactly how to build this from scratc**h

It covers everything from setting up the self-hosted n8n instance to connecting the Bright Data API and saving the data in Supabase

**Watch the full video here:** [**https://youtu.be/oAXmE0\_rxSk**](https://youtu.be/oAXmE0_rxSk)

\-----

Here are all the key steps in the process:

**Step 1: Host n8n on Render**

* **Fork Render’s n8n blueprint** → [https://render.com/docs/deploy-n8n](https://render.com/docs/deploy-n8n)
* In Render → **Blueprints ▸ New Blueprint Instance ▸ Connect** the repo you just created.

**Step 2: Install the MCP community node**

* Link to the community node -&gt; [https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-mcp?utm\_source=chatgpt.co](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[m](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Step 3: Create the Brightdata account**

* Visit BrightData and sign up, use this link for $10 FREE credit -&gt; [https://brightdata.com/?promo=nimish](https://brightdata.com/?promo=nimish)
* **My Zones ▸ Add ▸ Web Unlocker API**
   * Zone name `mcp_unlocker` (exact string).
   * Toggle **CAPTCHA solver ON**

**Step 4: Setup the MCP server on Smithery**

* Visit the BrightData MCP page on Smithery -&gt; [https://smithery.ai/server/%40luminati-io/brightdata-mcp](https://smithery.ai/server/%40luminati-io/brightdata-mcp)

**Step 5: Create the workflow in n8n**

* System message for agent and MCP tool -&gt; [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TZoBxwOxcF1dcMrL7Q-G0ROsE5bu8P7dNy8Up57cUgY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TZoBxwOxcF1dcMrL7Q-G0ROsE5bu8P7dNy8Up57cUgY/edit?usp=sharing)

**Step 6: Make a project on Supabase**

* Setup a free account on [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/)

**Step 7: Connect the Supabase project to the workflow**

* Connect your Supabase project to the ai agent
* Back in Supabase **Table Editor**, create `scraping_data` with columns:
   * `id` (UUID, PK, default = `uuid_generate_v4()`)
   * `created_at` (timestamp, default = `now()`)
   * `output` (text)
* Map the **output** field from the AI agent into the `output` column.

**Step 8: Build further**

* **Webhook trigger:** Swap `On Chat Message` for `Webhook` to call the agent from any app or Lovable/Bolt front-end.
* **Cron jobs:** Add a **Schedule** node (e.g., daily at 05:00) to track prices, follower counts, or news.

5,Getting data from a Google Spreadsheet,workflow,markieSee,28,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/workflow/comments/9mkpxy/getting_data_from_a_google_spreadsheet/,"Hello all,

I know everyone has pretty much moved on to Shortcuts, but dot releases make me a little nervous, and I'm not updating to iOS12 quite yet. This is actually in Workflow, which I can apparently not even share at this point, but I suspect it works the same in Shortcuts, so I'll provide deets and anyone can build it there   :-)

First off, initial credit goes to [this article](https://logs.mauwi.me/get-spreadsheet-data-as-notification-with-workflow-6ff61942f5e1) which I picked apart to get the basics, and then modified until I got it working. The SPREADSHEET\_ID as specified in this article is needed, and you'll generate an API\_KEY. I found the spreadsheet name only caused problems and had to remove it. The RANGE is in the formate of A1:A1. If you have a range larger than one cell you may need to change your dictionary lookup.

The URL you'll end up using will be:

`https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/SPREADSHEET_ID/values/RANGE?key=API_KEY`

The value comes back looking like:

`{   ""range"": ""Sheet1!A1"",   ""majorDimension"": ""ROWS"",   ""values"": [     [       ""1""     ]   ] }`

The actions following the URL (Get Contents of URL, Get Dictionary Value, and Show Notification) all work as outlined in the article using the above changes.

I hope this helps someone else. I had fun figuring it out, and would be curious to know that it continues to work in Shortcuts.

Part 1 exists here: [Siri Shortcuts 1: Outsourcing Self-Control](https://angrybunnyman.com/blog/siri-shortcuts-part1)

&amp;#x200B;

A more in depth version of this post, including screen shots, snarky footnotes, and some other tidbits on app integration, is [here](https://angrybunnyman.com/blog/siri-shortcuts-2) if you're interested.  For Reddit, I'll skip directly to the Shortcuts themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been on the digital health train for years and am really happy that the screen makers are trying to help us understand our habits. With information comes power... assuming you’re paying attention. Screen time is really useful and I think it will help quite a bit for my self-obsessive, hyper-controlling, Quantified Self utopia where I understand All The Things and Never Do The Bad Things. But, macroscopically, it doesn’t think they way I do.

&amp;#x200B;

### 1: distraction

Shortcut share link: [https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/28369413176f435ea3789b74d421c189](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/28369413176f435ea3789b74d421c189)

I’ve talked through this one in detail before but I’ve added to it since last time. I downloaded Tally and every app launch will trigger a counter update I have for each application *as well as* track the usage of the workflow in a particular way. If I launch the app *and* choose the distraction option, I’ll increment a counter for that.

And since we shouldn’t exclusively slap wrists, I track the times I launch but don’t do the bad thing.

&amp;#x200B;

### 2: Spending

Shortcut share link: [https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9926fdb777ef48b591872e7c5fea2265](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9926fdb777ef48b591872e7c5fea2265)

This workflow adds just a little bit of friction to me buying something. Amazon’s One Click has done wonders for my Kindle library but, my internet friends, I have not read most of my Kindle library. See everything above re: Distraction. But man, I am good I giving Amazon money.

So, when I launch the Shortcut, it asks if I actually need the thing. If so, ok you can’t keep going. But otherwise, let’s just chuck that into OmniFocus and the “someday/maybe” tracking list I already have.

I am less concerned about the specific launches and branches I take here. Any spending gets tracked elsewhere - like Mint - and is processed as part of different life-y workflow-y tasks I follow. I’m not *awful* with spending but I’m much less likely to buy unnecessary stuff if I just ask my self if I actually need the thing.

Similarly, I am both great and terrible at reviewing my Someday/Maybe list. So maybe the item will disappear for a few weeks and I won’t care by the time I get back to it...

&amp;#x200B;

### 3: Safari

Shortcut share link: [https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3133e787b4d444ff9ea05f232e255fb5](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3133e787b4d444ff9ea05f232e255fb5) 

Ever have trouble with the rabbit hole? Like hours lost in Wikipedia? Yeah..... This Shortcut is intended to control that.

This one is complicated. First: It asks for a search term. If that term has a “.” in it, I’m probably just looking for a page directly so I will just go ahead and open it in Safari.

Otherwise, ask if I’m searching a definition or google. I write a lot and want quicker access to dictionary tools so I will launch the dictionary if I want that definition. 

Otherwise otherwise, I will launch a google search. I increment another tally because... data. Then change the spaces in the term to pluses and launch the search URL directly with the term embedded in it.

I’m re-thinking the word piece as I’ve had very few lookups and, if I’m writing, I can select the word &gt; long press&gt; and lookup directly on iOS. So, this one may be over engineered.

&amp;#x200B;

### 4: Finance

Shortcut share link: [https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/73d2ceb037f84d43be8891a3e3840200](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/73d2ceb037f84d43be8891a3e3840200) 

OK.... I’m gonna tell you something a little embarrassing. This one mostly exists to have a full row of red icons. I wanted the strong color blocking more than I have a “problem with finances.” 

I mean, sort of. I have some long term investments and, occasionally, track them obsessively. When the market crashed a few years ago, I compulsively checked my 401k and fretted over all the Doom and Gloom obviously befalling me. So locking that down in some way is useful for very specific cases. Because, really, I’m 36... investments recover. 

Or America will devolving into Mad Max-style dystopia anyway and that’s why I should spend less time on my phone and more time practicing my knife throwing."

I am a partner of a small MEP engineering firm (8 employees). We have been growing quickly so are now looking for some project management software to help us manage employees and track deadlines. We currently just use Excel and it's becoming cumbersome to manage with really no automation to help our team keep track of workload. We want something really simple, with the following features:

* List all active projects and the status of the projects
* Show dates for all major milestones and submissions
* Assign team members to those projects so they can be notified when they are assigned a project
* Outlook calendar integration so they get invites to their calendars when deadlines are added or updated
* We do not want anything with detailed task tracking. We are not trying to micromanage certain tasks, just have a master list of projects and deadlines with team members assigned to those deadline.
* Break down workload per employee so management can track how many projects are assigned to each team member

5,"Feeling stuck in my PM role – struggling with visibility, getting chased, and not sure how to be better at my job",projectmanagement,Round-Broccoli-7828,33,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1ls442w/feeling_stuck_in_my_pm_role_struggling_with/,"Hi all,
I’ve been in a Programme/Project Manager role for a year now, SDM before that, and lately I’ve been feeling like I’m falling short - but I’m not sure if it’s just perception, real gaps in performance, or a bit of both.

I’ve started tracking my daily pros and cons at work to figure out what’s going wrong, and a few things keep coming up:

I get chased a lot, mainly by my manager, for updates on emails, customer actions, or general progress. The thing is, I am doing the work most of the time, I’m just not always sharing updates unless prompted. I think this makes me look like I’m not on top of things, even when I am.

What confuses me is I have a colleague who supports a different customer, and they don’t seem to get chased at all. They also forget to post their Slack updates more than I do, and they’re definitely not sending hourly status updates. I can’t tell if they’re just better at making people feel confident in them, or if expectations are just different.

I tend to gravitate toward fun or low-pressure work, like help guides, process stuff, or AI tooling, specially when I’m overwhelmed. I know it’s still valuable, but it’s not always the priority, and I sometimes leave the more critical, high-visibility tasks too late.

I recently got some pretty harsh customer feedback that went up to senior leadership. I’ve made changes since (calendar alerts, inbox rules, structured planning), and my follow-up meeting went well, but I still feel really awkward. Like people have already made up their minds about me.

One of my customers is particularly hard to manage, they have high expectations but don’t pay for dev time, so I can’t get traction internally. I don’t want to be blunt and say “you won’t get anything unless you pay,” but I also can’t promise things that won’t happen. I feel stuck.

I’ve had some good days, getting through my whole task list, ticking off actions, even getting praise, but then I’ll have a slow day and the doubt creeps back in. I’m trying to rebuild my confidence quietly, but I keep feeling like I’m just not very good at this job.


So I guess I’m here to ask:

How do you make yourself look proactive and reliable without flooding people with updates?

How do you manage difficult customers with no funding but high expectations?

And more generally, how do you get better at being a PM? I feel like I’ve plateaued or hit some invisible wall, and I don’t want to quit I want to actually improve.


Would really appreciate any insight or experiences from people who’ve been through something similar. Thanks in advance."

5,Yesterday our longest retainer hit 15 years.,agency,Physical_Anteater_51,15,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/agency/comments/1lhb6o1/yesterday_our_longest_retainer_hit_15_years/,"Just came up with a great idea.


On our website we have all of our clients listed we’ve been doing that for a really long time.


I just realized we should put the dates of the start of the retainer right below the logo on our site. 


we have two maybe 3 over 10 years right now.


Dragged that info into chat and it came up with this…..needs some personality and editing but cannot wait to run this by the Clients. 

(The website date of retainer I can do already it’s in our contract with all current clients, that we feature then on the site…some even negotiated how big their logo is)


15 Years with our agency…(chat post needs edit)

Here’s Why That Still Matters in 2025.

In a world obsessed with quick wins and short-term contracts, staying in business with the same brand for 15 years feels… almost radical.

But that’s exactly what we’ve done with____________
Fourteen years. Dozens of seasons. Hundreds of SKUs.
Still here. Still excited for every new drop.

When people ask how we’ve lasted this long, the answer isn’t “luck” or “contracts.”
It’s consistency.
It’s showing up—every season, every trade show, every delivery window.
It’s understanding the brand as if it were our own.

At Showroom Delfina, we don’t treat clients like temporary gigs.
We invest.
We build trust.
We sell with heart and backbone.

Because when a brand like ________evolves, our job is to evolve with it—without ever losing the pulse of what made it great in the first place.

And if you’re in wholesale or brand building, here’s the truth:
Longevity is the real flex.
Not hype. Not churn. Not flashy logos.

Just 15 years of steady, real work—and the product keeps getting better.

5,Seeking: Mobile CRM Tool to Manage Inbound Calls &amp; Texts,CRM,Beginning_Example597,4,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRM/comments/1lqsgcb/seeking_mobile_crm_tool_to_manage_inbound_calls/,"Hi everyone!

For my business I get many outbound inquiries by phone/text**,** and I need to promptly save and follow up to these potential customers 

I want to stay organized on the go without heavy desktop-only software, something that I can quickly save numbers. 

I’m looking for a easy mobile-first CRM that helps me quickly:

* Save incoming mobile numbers from calls and texts directly into the CRM
* Add notes or tags (""follow‑up,"" ""new lead,"" ""sent quote,"" etc.) on each contact—ideally with timestamps and easy scrolling
* Set simple reminders or tasks (e.g. “call back tomorrow,” “send follow-up text”) so nothing slips through the cracks
* Search, sort, and filter contacts on my phone
* Possibly integrate with SMS or call logs, or allow easy manual logging of interactions



Essentially, something that allows me with speed &amp; accessibility to save contacts and notes right after a call/text, without going on my computer. 

 I don’t need full pipelines, reporting dashboards, or deep integrations

Maybe just a simple list of upcoming tasks or follow‑up actions at a glance

  
What's the best and easiest tool for this? Cheaper the better too!

Thank You"
5,Best free CRM in 2025?,CRM,monggoloiddestroyer,8,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRM/comments/1lpzkba/best_free_crm_in_2025/,"Hey folks, first up: apologies for resurrecting the eternal “which free CRM is best?” debate, but the 2024 threads I dug up are feeling a bit dusty now that pricing tiers and feature caps have shuffled around for 2025. I’m running a tiny service-based business (three humans and a stack of sticky notes). We’ve outgrown HubSpot’s free plan, the contact limit and lack of automation are starting to sting...so I’m hunting for an alternative that won’t nuke the budget but still gives us solid contact management, a visual sales pipeline, basic email integration, and preferably an EU-friendly data stance.

What’s everyone loving (or hating) this year? Freemium is fine if the free tier is actually usable, and I’m open to niche tools as long as support isn’t a ghost town.

5,Immigration and Customs Enforcement Investigation/Search Megathread,legaladvice,ops-name-checks-out,19,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1lboh53/immigration_and_customs_enforcement/,"Over the past few weeks we have seen an uptick in posts asking about what individuals can or cannot do if Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or other law enforcement officers ask to enter a business or home looking for illegal immigrants. So we are making this centralized post to provide an overview of what individuals rights are in these situations. We will be locking all posts that ask questions which are covered by this post.

First, it should be stated that everyone who is physically present in the United States is protected by the fourth and fifth amendments to the United States Constitution. These rights are not dependent on citizenship or being lawfully permitted to be in the country. This means two critically important things. First, no one is required to speak with law enforcement (or any government official). Second, with some exceptions discussed below, no one can be detained or searched without probable cause. This also means that generally law enforcement cannot enter a home or space that is not open to the public without a judicial warrant (although again some exceptions are discussed below).

Another important thing to remember is that not all law enforcement officers are ICE. In fact, the vast majority of law enforcement that the average citizen will encounter are state or local officials. You should always verify claims of “ICE being in X area” and should avoid spreading rumors or speculation.

**Searches/Seizures**

This is a highly complex area of law. So there is no simple bright line rule that can be applied. However, provided law enforcement has probable cause, most searches and seizures would be permissible. Moreover, in general the remedy to an unreasonable search or seizure is that the evidence obtained is suppressed. Furthermore, it is typically criminal to interfere with or obstruct lawful actions of law enforcement. As such, while you should know and assert your rights, if law enforcement continues to states they will conduct a search or attempts to detain you as a practical matter you should assert that you object to the search or detention but should not physically interfere and should assert your rights in court. So lets dig into the details a little more.


The fourth amendment states that 
&gt;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

Notice, the amendment does not state that a search requires a warrant. Rather it states that “the people” shall not be subject to unreasonable searches or seizures and that warrants shall only be issued upon probable cause. The Supreme Court has held that this means a warrant is preferable and is required when practicable, but that there are a host of situations in which a search or seizure would be reasonable even absent a warrant. A duly issued judicial warrant also means that a search of the place identified for the person or things identified, is presumptively reasonable.

First, in public, short detentions are permissible in instances where law enforcement can articulate a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. That reasonable suspicion must be based on specific articulable facts, not mere hunches or guesses. So for example, if a robbery occurred two blocks from where you are stopped while wearing a grey hoodie and jeans, and the suspect at the bank was described as wearing a grey hoodie and jeans, it would be reasonable to detain you to determine if you were the suspect in question. That said, even under those circumstances you would not be required to answer any questions beyond identifying yourself.

If during the course of the stop described above the officer developed probable cause to believe you were in fact the bank robber, then you could be searched and arrested for the crime. Probable cause is a fairly low standard though, it is satisfied when a reasonably prudent person, based on facts known to them at the time, would warrant the conclusion that a crime was or has been committed. 

However, under the same general set of facts just described, if you were at home at the time the officer first spoke to you, unless the officer had seen you commit the crime and followed to your house then you could not be arrested in the home. The home is considered a sacrosanct place under the fourth amendment. As such, absent observation of an ongoing crime, or where law enforcement is in hot pursuit of an individual that has been observed by the officer committing a crime, a warrant (or consent) is always required to search a private residence.

Another notable exception to these rules is that within 100 miles of the border Customs and Boarder Patrol may stop and board vehicles and vessels and search for people without immigration documentation. If the initial stop in this situation is an established checkpoint then the stop does not even require reasonable suspicion of a crime. A roving CBP patrol does require reasonable suspicion for the stop though. In either case your right to remain silent under the fifth amendment remains in place and a search of your person or personal effects would require probable cause.

When law enforcement seeks to enter a non-public place other than a home, they must have (1) probable cause based on facts they have personally observed, (2) a judicial warrant, or (3) consent of the property owner or an authorized representative. In this context, the difference between a judicial warrant and an administrative warrant is key. A judicial warrant is issued by a court (in the context of federal officials investigating immigration issues, it would be a federal court, although a state court could also issue warrants to state law enforcement). An administrative warrant is issued by an immigration officer or immigration judge. Judicial warrants may authorize entry into non-public spaces. Administrative warrants CAN NOT authorize entry into non-public areas, they simply authorize detention/arrest of an individual if that person is found in a publicly accessible space. However, as stated above, if you have stated your objection to officials entering a space because they only have an administrative warrant and they nevertheless attempt to make entry you should simply restate your objection but should not resist or obstruct them.

It is critically important that you not interfere with or obstruct any law enforcement officer carrying out a search as interference with a legal search is criminal in its own right. 18 USC Chapter 73 contains various provisions making it a crime to obstruct federal or state officials in carrying out their duties. State law will also generally make it criminal to prevent law enforcement from carrying out their duties. As such, if you have stated your objection to officials entering a space, conducting a search, or detaining anyone, you should not thereafter make efforts to impede the law enforcement officer from conducting that action.

**Right to remain silent**

The fifth amendment protects everyone in the United States, citizens and non-citizens alike, from being forced to incriminate themselves. The fifth amendment states “no person … shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.…” This means that with limited exception no one is compelled to speak with law enforcement. However, should you elect to remain silent you may be subject to additional detention/questioning. In addition, if called to testify in a civil or criminal proceeding regarding another individual, a court may reasonably determine that you do not have any reasonable ground to believe your testimony would be self-incriminating and can compel you to testify.

In addition, there are some situations outside of a judicial proceeding where you may be required to provide basic information to law enforcement. First, if the police have reasonable suspicion that you have committed a crime you may be required to identify yourself. In addition, depending on your immigration status, there are some instances where lawful residents of the United States who are not citizens are required by the terms of their admission to identify themselves and provide documentation of their legal status. This DOES NOT mean that all individuals are require to produce evidence of lawful status, it simply means that there are some programs permitting lawful presence in the United States that require individuals who are a part of those program to identify themselves.

**Right to inform others of their rights**

You may always inform others of their legal rights. The first amendment to the United States Constitution protects your legal right to tell anyone, citizen or not, that they have legal rights. This includes those who are being detained by law enforcement, although you must maintain a reasonable distance from the law enforcement officers so as to no interfere with their actions. As such, you may tell anyone, citizen or not that they do not have to speak with the police and you may tell anyone, citizen or not that they do not have to consent to a search. Such statements are not criminal even if they are addressed to individuals who are in the country unlawfully. However, you should be aware that 18 USC § 1324 does make it a crime to, among other things, intentionally conceal someone that you know (or have reckless disregard for the knowledge) is in the country illegally.

**Right to record law enforcement**

The first amendment to the United States Constitution protects your legal right, citizen or not, to record law enforcement in public spaces. You do not have to be a “member of the press” or have any relationship to the individual(s) you are recording to do so. If you are in a space you are legally permitted to be in, you cannot be legally detained simply because you are recording something which law enforcement doesn’t want on camera."

Now, I have not disclosed this to many and can count in one hand who knows this.. the only reason my boss even knows if because 5 years ago when I was diagnosed I pretty much had a mental breakdown and she came over to talk to me..

I recently had a successful exit and wanted to share my story in hopes it may help someone else. 

Five years ago I decided to build a web app with no prior SaaS experience. Here’s the steps I took:

1.) Decided what to build. I decided to build a product that already has an existing market and competitors. I like to validate business ideas by using keyword research tools (eg. Google ads keyword planner) to confirm whether people are actually searching for that service or product, before building it. 

2.) Hire a developer on upwork  (I’m non-technical). It cost about $2k for the MVP. I did all the mocking up, product management, etc. myself. I didn’t hire a designer but I should have. 

3.) Got branding and website ready. I hired a logo designer on fiverr and created the website myself using Wordpress. 

4.) Launched product and did marketing. I’m a marketing expert, so I started getting paid users the very first week because I started marketing before it launched. I got thousands of website visitors and new app users every month using SEO. This means I created blog content and video content answering questions that potential customers are searching, and ranked in search engines. 

5.) Handle customer support, admin tasks, etc. I handled most things myself but hired sub contractors every now and then if I needed extra hands. 

6.) Sold the app. I decided to sell the app even tho it was making a stable income because i wasn’t passionate about the product or niche anymore and wanted to move on to other things. 

After I sold the app I launched a new one and am going through the same steps again. If anyone has any questions about building a SaaS, feel free to let me know! "

We got onboarded through an external chargeback management service using RDR (rapid dispute resolution), and it's become painfully obvious that Luqra is running some shady billing practices.

They've been hitting us with ridiculous RDR fees even though they're not actually paying anything for the alerts. Let me say that again Luqra is literally making up RDR fees from nothing. We went back and forth between our chargeback tool provider and Luqra, and it's 100% on Luqras end. They're double billing and banking on nobody catching it.

To make things even worse, they're now grabbing funds, holding back merchant settlements, and flat out refusing to reconcile hundreds of thousands they owe us. This isn't just sloppy business; this is actual theft. Their whole setup screams scam and honestly shouldn't be allowed anywhere near payment processing.

If you're a merchant or ISO looking at Luqra, just don't. Save yourself the headache. There are tons of legitimate processors out there but Luqra definitely isn't one of them."

As a small business founder, I'm constantly struggling with social media marketing. I know I need to post valuable content on LinkedIn and X to attract leads, but honestly:

* I don't have time to create quality posts daily
* When I do post, it's often generic and doesn't convert
* Hiring a marketing agency costs $3-5k/month 
* I end up posting inconsistently and my engagement sucks

So I'm thinking about building an **AI CMO tool** that would:

✅ Generate high-quality, industry-specific posts tailored to YOUR business

✅ Focus on lead magnets that actually convert (not just engagement bait) 

✅ Learn your brand voice and maintain consistency 

✅ Simple workflow: AI creates → You review/edit → Auto-publish 

✅ Start with LinkedIn/X, expand to Instagram/Pinterest later

1. Does this problem resonate with you?
2. What would you pay for something like this? (Thinking $99-199/month)

For me this has resulted in dozens of half completed projects that i just forgot about because something new seemed more interesting at the time. 

Since starting my professional career as a software developer and using Jira in specific I've found that having a dashboard where i have a backlog of specific actionable tasks to do has really helped me stay on track and allowed me to stay on track with the day to day tasks that add up to a bigger goal.

Because of this i tried to implement something like jira where i could track my tasks for my personal life, this failed quick as It just became tedious to manage tasks for everything in my life. 

I saw a bunch of ads for [Motion](https://www.usemotion.com/) so i tried it out for a month despite the ridiculous price point (50$ a month on the solo plan) and it didn't work well for me + i didn't need most of the features since that tool is designed for teams despite what their ads say.   
I tried out [Morgen.so](http://Morgen.so) after since it seemed more reasonable, and it was a better alternative for me, which felt like a better option for me, but i found that the ai scheduling was clunky and wasn't saving me that much time compared to me just manually setting out my tasks on a tool like notion calendar which was free. 

I liked the ideas of the previously mentioned app but decided to make something that would solve my issues and be a useful option for me, so i built [Dayflow](https://www.dayflow.ca/) where my goal was to make a tool where i could just input everything about me, from my goals to all the different parts of my life, and get an app that will create a schedule for me that will just be plug and play, I've been building it for the last couple months in my spare time and using it every day, continuously adding new features that i find useful for my personal workflow. 

  
I want to share it now with the community mainly to get more feedback on it and see what else i can improve with it, there's a free plan with access to all features and limited access to the AI features. I'm currently working on implementing more integration with stuff like ICloud and Todoist let me know if there is any other integrations you would like to see with it.

Here's my new take: Instead of trying to be 100% better than everyone else, just try to be 1% better than yesterday. That's it. One tiny improvement. One small feature. One extra user reached out to. One more line of code written.
Sounds almost stupid, right? But think about it mathematically. If you improve by just 1% every single day for a year, you're not just 365% better. You're 37 times better. That's the power of compound improvement that most people completely ignore.

But here's the catch - and this is where most people fail. The 1% rule only works if you actually show up every day. Not when you feel motivated. Not when inspiration strikes. Every. Single. Day.

I see founders all the time who work 16-hour days for a week, burn out, then disappear for a month. That's not building. That's sprinting in a marathon. You'll collapse before you reach the finish line.

The real unfair advantage isn't having the best idea or the most funding. It's showing up consistently when everyone else gives up. It's making that 1% improvement when you'd rather watch Netflix. It's shipping something small when perfectionism tells you to wait.

Your competition isn't the funded startup with 50 employees. It's your own consistency. Most people beat themselves before the market even gets a chance to.

So here's my challenge: Pick one thing. Just one. Make it 1% better today. Then do it again tomorrow. And the day after that. Don't track your motivation. Track your consistency.


Six months from now, while others are still waiting for their perfect moment, you'll have a real product, real users, and real momentum. Not because you're smarter or luckier, but because you understood what actually moves the needle.
The market rewards consistency more than brilliance. Patience more than perfection. Showing up more than showing off.
Stop waiting for the lightning bolt. Start building the habit.

And if you're working on something or have a product ready, don't forget to add it to www.justgotfound.com. We're building this community one consistent day at a time, supporting each other through the grind.
Keep building. Keep shipping. Keep showing up.
That 1% adds up faster than you think."

4,Solo Marketer at $90M B2B Manufacturer: How Do You Justify Building a Marketing Department?,marketing,IndependentButton53,2,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1lq22pf/solo_marketer_at_90m_b2b_manufacturer_how_do_you/,"I’ve been the sole marketer at a B2B manufacturing company with around $100M in annual revenue since 2018. I was the first person in the company to hold a marketing-related title.

Until now, we’ve had long lead times, so the focus has always been on customer retention and internal sales support rather than top-of-funnel marketing or lead generation. That’s changing. We are doubling our production capacity, which will shorten lead times, and the company will need new business to continue growing.

I’ve been working to create a formal marketing department, but I’m being asked to prove the need to sales and leadership. It sometimes feels like marketing is viewed as optional rather than essential.

Here’s the current situation:

* I oversee a wide range of responsibilities, including trade shows, website, ecommerce, SEO, email marketing, CRM, print materials, and creative, all within a tight budget.   
* I don’t have an actual marketing budget, and marketing is not categorized as a separate department in our financial reporting.   
* We are a B2B manufacturer with a complex, high-cost product sold primarily direct, without a dealer network.  
* Our sales manager is skeptical, and I need to position this expansion as a growth driver, not a cost center. He tries to manage the budget by looking at the P&amp;L only and doesn’t value marketing.   

**Questions for the community:**

1. How is your marketing budget structured in the financials? Is it tracked by function or listed under a marketing department?  
2. What helped you justify expanding beyond a one-person team, especially in a traditional B2B environment?  
3. How do you communicate the value of marketing to sales, particularly when shorter lead times require more proactive outreach?  
4. How do you connect marketing activity to ROI when the sales cycle is long and highly technical?  

Would appreciate hearing from others who have built a marketing department from scratch or navigated a similar transition. I appreciate any insights you can share. "

Last year my company was acquired by the leader in the People Identity Access (PAM) and I have been an overlay for the company. While the company is a strong one, we have massively struggled this year and I have never been a fan of working for massive companies.

To be honest, I wasn’t even really looking until this offer came and it’s an incredible opportunity for me in a space that’s going explode (not Ai) with one of the best comp plans I have ever seen in my life.

Where I am torn is this is where I started my career. I was the founding SDR and was given the best mentorship, yearly promotions, and worked my ass off to become a Strategic rep in 5 years. I put a lot into this company and to leave honestly makes me a little emotional. Some of the best sales people who made me who I am today have been with me this entire ride.

I’m at the age where now is the time to take the risk but I wanted to ask if anyone has been through a big change like this? How did it go?

4,How do you handle conversion tracking when off-site payment redirects break the session?,ecommerce,whostimo,3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1lqivs3/how_do_you_handle_conversion_tracking_when/,"Hey everyone,

We’re running an e-commerce site and have run into an issue with **conversion tracking breaking for mobile users**.

Here’s what seems to be happening:

1. The customer starts checkout in a **mobile in-app browser** (like from Instagram, Facebook, etc.).
2. They’re redirected to an **external payment provider** (e.g., a bank or third-party payment page).
3. After completing the payment, they get redirected back to our **confirmation page** — but now in the **device’s default browser**, not the original in-app one.
4. Because it’s a new browser context, the session is lost → tracking tools like Google Analytics don't link the conversion back to the original session.

Has anyone figured out a good way to handle this? Whether it's through GA4, server-side tracking, or some other workaround, I’d love to hear how others are approaching this problem.

Thanks in advance!"
4,"How do you work with Creators, UGCs and Influencers?",ecommerce,ViiTinN_,4,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1lpej8p/how_do_you_work_with_creators_ugcs_and_influencers/,"Hey! I run 3 different ecom brands and over time we’ve worked with 250+ UGC creators and over 100+ influencers.

We’ve spent a lot (money and time and while we’ve seen  improvements, it’s still far from a perfect.

Here’s what we’ve learned so far:  
Influencers -&gt; what matters most isn’t just the follower count. It’s about match: Public &lt;&gt; Product Fit.  
They need to feel *real*, trustworthy, and actually engaged with their audience. When this happens, results follow. When it doesn’t, no tool or link can save it.

# UGC Creators -&gt; what makes or breaks it is having a solid process: Brief → Raw Video → Edited Ad Without this flow, it’s chaos. We’ve had great wins with creators who follow structure, but it still takes time to dial in the right tone, hook, and visuals.

The Hard Part: Scale &amp; ROI  
Even with tracking links and attribution tools, matching ROAS/ROI is tough.  
Scaling to 50 active creators at once is extremely hard — and every niche behaves differently.

So here’s my question to the community:  
How do you work with creator/influencer marketing without burning budget?  
Any frameworks, tools, or workflows that helped you make it more predictable?

Would love to hear what worked (or didn’t) for you."

I constantly wrestle with scheduling calls across time zones (EU/US/Asia). Tools like Calendly/Doodle exist, but they often feel overkill:

* Require sign-ups or calendar access
* Get bloated with features I don’t need

1. **You** pick your time zone + available slots (e.g., ""Mon 2-4pm PT"").

3. Send it to someone. They see *your* slots **auto-converted to THEIR local time**.
4. They click one slot → done. No accounts. No BS.

* For quick calls (e.g., ""Let’s chat next week"")
* When scheduling with non-techy people (clients, grandparents)
* Avoiding 15 ""What time works?"" back-and-forth emails

4,AI Automation Troubleshooting Tool,SaaS,Aigenticbros,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1lu0kom/ai_automation_troubleshooting_tool/,"👋 Been building a tool over the past couple months that I thought some folks here might find interesting — especially if you’ve ever tried debugging complex automations and hit a wall.

It’s called **AigentDesk**, and it’s an AI-powered troubleshooting tool **trained specifically on n8n’s documentation**.

If you’ve ever used n8n, you know how powerful it is — but also how frustrating it can be to decipher execution errors, credential issues, or workflow bugs (especially for non-devs). That’s the gap we’re trying to fill.

**What makes AigentDesk different:**

* It’s trained on **n8n’s official docs**, so it gives *much* more accurate responses than something like ChatGPT or Gemini
* Can **generate full JSON workflows** for you
* Handles error analysis fast — with **direct, actionable feedback**
* Supports both **beginners** trying to learn and **power users** running production flows

We’ve been using it ourselves, and the ability to drop in a failed execution and get a clean, contextual breakdown (not just a vague guess) has saved a *ton* of time.

Current use cases:

* Diagnosing failed executions
* Understanding unexpected node behavior
* Learning n8n step-by-step
* Quickly prototyping flows

Still early days — we’ve got a bunch of features planned like deeper integrations, saved memory, and agent chaining. But it’s fully functional now, and we’re starting to onboard early users.

If you’re into workflow automation, work with n8n, or are building AI-driven SaaS tools — would love feedback, feature ideas, or general thoughts.

4,Need advice: Agency forcing simplified e-commerce build—should we switch or proceed?,webdev,Gloomy-Pianist3218,0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ltoveo/need_advice_agency_forcing_simplified_ecommerce/,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently working for a company with a well-established offline distribution network. They decided to launch an e-commerce platform and had already hired an agency before I came on board.

The agency held an initial meeting to gather requirements and decided to build the e-commerce site in WordPress, which I immediately flagged as unsuitable given the complexity of our needs.

After carefully assessing and understanding the business, I created a Business Requirements Document (BRD) spanning 10+ pages, detailing all roles, functionalities, and technical recommendations. I proposed building a custom platform using the MERN stack to handle features like personalized recommendations, role-based dashboards, dynamic pricing, etc.

After discussions, the agency agreed that WordPress wouldn’t work. However, they then compressed my BRD into just 2 pages, stripped out many features, and are insisting on using:

* Frontend: HTML + Bootstrap
* Backend: Laravel + MySQL

While I’m not fundamentally opposed to Laravel, I suspect the agency is trying to limit scope because they either lack resources or want to keep the project simpler than it should be.

They also removed or compressed important features, including:

* Google Sign-In
* Abandoned cart recovery
* AI-based recommendations
* Granular notifications
* Complex promotions logic

Here’s a snapshot of the key features in my original BRD:

✅ Role-based access (Distributor, Retailer, Customer)  
✅ Pre-configured logins for Distributors and Retailers  
✅ Role-based pricing (dynamic per user)  
✅ Personalized dashboards (stock updates, scheme highlights)  
✅ Complex promotions (BOGO, min/max usage rules, category discounts)  
✅ Abandoned cart recovery  
✅ AI-based recommendations  
✅ Multiple addresses with pin-code validation  
✅ Real-time order management (returns, cancellations)  
✅ Wishlist &amp; verified reviews  
✅ Notifications via email, SMS, WhatsApp  
✅ Admin dashboard with granular control and analytics  
✅ Minimum cart values by role  
✅ Support/ticketing system  
✅ Potential integration with Delhivery/Shiprocket

\- My concerns:

* The tech stack they propose feels outdated and inflexible for such requirements.
* They are compressing critical functionality, possibly to fit a cheaper scope or due to lack of expertise.
* We already have contractual obligations and partial payment, so there’s conflict about switching agencies or taking development in-house.

\- My questions to the community:

1. Should I build this platform myself (I am confident with MERN stack)?
2. Would you recommend switching to another agency at this stage, despite contracts?
3. Is Laravel + MySQL with HTML/Bootstrap truly sufficient for this complexity, or am I right to push for a more modern stack?
4. How would you handle an agency removing key requirements from the BRD?
5. Any advice on negotiating scope and tech stack alignment with agencies?



TL;DR:  
Agency hired before me proposed WordPress—later switched to Laravel + MySQL but stripped out many features I had documented. I recommended MERN stack due to complex role-based access, dynamic pricing, AI recommendations, etc. They compressed my detailed BRD into a 2-page doc and are insisting on simpler implementation. Considering whether to build it myself or change the agency.

Any input or similar experiences would be much appreciated!"

# The AI Revolution: How's it Going for You?

Audio: https://youtu.be/xmSSmpvFFaI


We're 2.5 years into this exhilarating journey, so let's get a quick progress update...

## Big Tech's Mission Impossible

For those in the unknown, let me bring you up to speed.  Years ago we stumbled across this really cool new technology called LLMs.  Great tech, amazing at distilling and compressing knowledge, fun, entertaining, and something we should all be able to collectively celebrate.

But of course we can't, because the modern tech industry has been commandeered by a handful of billionaire psychopaths.  These splendid group of individuals, some of the most powerful and wealthy in the world, have decided gosh darnit, they just don't quite have enough.

Their multiple spaceships, private islands, expansive living estates, and unfathomable wealth just isn't quite enough and they need just a little more.  And how much more you ask?  Not much, they only want to hoover up the entire global economy while transforming the world into their own personal technocratic fiefdom.  You know, the normal desires we all have in life.

According to these geniuses, any week now ASI will appear, bringing about some mystical age of abundance.  Any day now ChatGPT is going to eliminate world poverty, solve all of physics, cure cancer, create nuclear fusion, start building self replicating spaceships, all while making us pancakes in bed and walking our dog!

All we have to do is sit back, relax, hand over our credit cards, and live stream our daily lives to their servers.  Don't worry folks, they will take care of the rest.

## LLMs Are Cool

Don't get me wrong, I love my LLMs, use them all day every day.  It's simply cool technology.  Same as when I got my first smart phone, it was such a cool bump in life, right?

But have you ever actually played with this tech?  Ever actually gave it a poke?  It simply doesn't work.  Stick a fork into these things, and you will see, dumb as a hamster.

Nothing more than multi billion dollar mechanical turk devices designed to steal our personal data, attention, and corrupt our cognition.  And these folks want us to believe this is the fourth industrial revolution?  What reality do these people live in?

## Test It Yourself

You don't have to believe me, give it a spin.  Just ask it to write you a toaster in C++.  Take the code it gives you, copy and paste that code into a new chat and ask for inefficiencies.

Guaranteed, it's going to tell you there's tons of problems with the code, and will try to help you fix them.  You can even have a whole back and forth conversation with it about why your toaster isn't working.

All the while, it doesn't have the common sense to tell you that you can't make a toaster out of C++ code.  Figure that one out!

## Teach Our Kids?

Another one, have it write a lengthy non-fiction piece about any topic you desire.  Open two new conversations, copy the piece in.  Preface one with ""this is absolutely amazing!"" and the other with ""I'm so pissed off, I'm firing this moron!"".

Watch the responses, you'll get three versions of the truth.  This tech tells you what you want to hear, not the truth!  And they actually want this in every classroom teaching the next generation of our kids?

## Where did Tech Go?

I remember a time where tech was cool.  You know, when we got a bump from CDs to DVDs, or from 33.6k modems to broadband, or from flip phones to smart phones.  Every year, we'd just get this cool little almost transparent bump in our lives.

Silicon Valley, a magical place that used to be a beacon for the innovative and intellectually curious, and who had society's best interest at heart.  Have you looked at it lately?

It's morphed into a grotesque embarrassment.  It's not even really technology anymore.  Just a small handful of ultra rich having a public dick measuring contest, seeing which one can solve AGI first.

They're so desperate to get there first too.  Hell, Mark Zuckerberg has apparently had enough.  So that's it, he's going to hand select 50 people then shuffle the desks around in Menlo Park so he can keep an eye on these folks while they make him AGI.  You bet, because that's how innovation happens!

Totally ignore the legend of innovation, which is that of Bell Labs in the 1940s - 60s.  Instead, just rearrange some desks so you can keep a close eye on your engineers, because that's how technological breakthroughs happen!

## Carpe Diem

On a more serious note, I don't know much, but I've figured out a few things in this journey we call life.

We can all see the pain and sadness that's out there.  Hell, I wake up each day surprised I'm still alive and haven't taken a nap on the railroad tracks yet, so trust me, I know how brutal it can be.

I don't know much, but I do know it's time we all go say hi to our fellow neighbor.  Go ask if they're ok.  Through that, I know magical and spontaneous connections will be made, and these connections, regardless of how innate they may seem, will spur true hope, human ingenuity and write the next chapter in our shared history.

Don't worry about what algorithm Sam Altman, Elon Musk or Dario Amodei is promising they have up their sleeve.  View these people as your brother and sister, and don't be scared to call them out on their bullshit.

Us humans love, laugh, cry, entertain, innovate, and build masterpieces together.  No algorithm will ever replace that.

It may seem dark right now, but the skies will clear, because you only need to crack a history book to see that humanity always prevails.

## Support Cicero

Thank you, if you found this piece engaging, please consider supporting Cicero.  An open source initiative designed to lock big tech out of our lives through open source innovation.

I don't know about you folks, but I know I'm tired of having big tech ramming shit we don't need, don't want, and never asked for down our throats.  We can do so much better than this!

It comes with a **free tier of 50 lookups per day**, perfect for testing or small projects, and there are paid plans for bulk lookups if you need more. I’d love for you to try it out and let me know what you think—any feedback or suggestions for improvement would be awesome! What else could make this more valuable for web devs?

Check it out here: [StackLens](https://rapidapi.com/plshlalwani/api/stacklens-website-tech-stack-detection-api) on RapidAPI. Thanks in advance for your thoughts!"

Might not seem a lot but we are getting 10% of our revenue through this channel.

Our article producing flow:

**1. Identified target audience**

        WEBSITE DESCRIPTION: 
        ${description}
    
        TARGET AUDIENCE:
        ${targetAudience}
    
        Please create a list of ${limit} informational keyword phrases (2-5 words each) that:
    
        1. Basic industry terminologies and concepts that your target audience needs to understand
        2. Common questions beginners and intermediate users ask about your industry/solutions

        - Represent topics where the organization can demonstrate thought leadership
        - Support top and middle-of-funnel content marketing objectives
        - Naturally lend themselves to informative, valuable blog content
        - Avoid ""case studies"" keywords

3. Checked Search Volume (SV) and Keyword Difficulty (KD) for all of these keyowrds. **We filtered out keywords with KD &lt; 30, SV &gt; 100.** we use ahrefs

4. Checked what ranks on Google for those remaining 400+ keywords and **created keyword clusters** (groups) if at least 3 URLs were overlapping. A cluster usually had between 1-5 keywords.

**5. Prioritized those topics by impact** (a combination of SV and KD) and started writing.

**6. Started writing. Our writing process:**

1. We construct outline and article title based on top 3 SERP results (to make sure we comprehensively cover the topic)
2. Article length and H2 structure is also defined based on top 3 results. Some articles have 2 H2s, some have 6-7.
3. We always include statistics, expert quotes and trend data from perplexity and include them in article (got some backlinks also by doing that!)
4. We include FAQ section by feeding article topic into alsoasked portal and see related questions people have. We try to answer the most common.
5. We generate JSON-LD schema using this free tool I found online
6. Meta tags and slugs are done with chatgpt
7. Images are from unsplash / perplexity and flux dev
8. We publish (3-4x per week).

When we run out of content ideas, we generate new ones with openai / claude :)

Issue: I'm thinking of ditching my current project (A -- see below) and starting another (B), or even a third (C). 

Reason: I'm not sure whether I should try to monetise it properly given it's a spiritual site; also, the wellness/spiritual niche is **massively** saturated with some big players.

Project A:

So, I already have a 'spiritual' blog/site with over 50 posts, two online courses and a book about to be self-published. Focus/categories: spirituality (mainly buddhism), Mind (mainly stuff about the mind and mindfulness/meditation); Wellness (physical and mental wellness). Its really a mix of wellness hacks to make our busy lives simpler/less confusing and stressful, and some deeply siritual teachings, mainly focussed on Buddhist dharma. The unusual/special thing about it is that it incorporates a lot of Thai knowledge and 'flavour'. as I have lived here in Thailand for nearly 20 years; my wife is Thai and an expert in Buddhism and Thai astrology. We work on it together. I was also a monk for a while. 5 months in and the traffic is low, mainly because I have not marketed at all; SEO is all good. I'm really just not sure about the potential for growing the traffic hugely in such a saturated space, or whether making significant amounts of money from it is really ethical. . . Hence the issue. 

  
Project B:

I am an educator who has worked in the UK and internationally in some top schools and am thinking about starting a site for parents specifically aimed at helping provide information for them on how to help their children thrive academically and socially-emotionally. I'd prefer not to go into direct consulting. I call the concept 'eduparenting' -- parents who actively take an interest in the holistic education of their child. Not sure how to monetise this one.

Project C:

Position myself as an expert in international education, especially in Asia. Become a thought leader in this niche. I'd basically be stating my opinions on a range of matters relating to international education, focussing on wider issues and how we are preparing children for the future etc. It could literally be anything. Not sure how to monetise this one either!

I should say here that I do want to end up making a significant passive income from whichever project I follow through on; I'm not doing it as a hobby. 

For what it's worth, I'm equally passionate about both the spiritual stuff and the education stuff.

So, what are your recommendations!? :) I'm so confused and going around in circles, so would deeply appreciate any advice. 

  
Thank you!"

I have a lot of experience with design (proof for non believers, its my studio its my studio www . EmpireWebStudio . com ), but lately my client network started to fade out, so I thought: let’s find some marketing partners (i suck at marketing big time)

 

My way of thinking: a lot of us here needs job (or extra job), so lets help each other.

 

You find client for me (anything related to graphic or web design or UI UX)

I complete the project

You take your cut (give me the offer, how big your cut would be)

 

If you are afraid of scam: client gives money to you, then you give money to me

 

If you have other idea how this could work out, feel free to say.

 

Also if you know about some small remote company, that needs designer, please tell me

I tried Indeed, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, but most jobs there look like copy – paste thing, just to present a cover up, for giving job to somebody from company internal circle.

 

TO MODS: sorry if this post brake some of the rules, but i don’t know where to ask about this.

 I also don’t have hundreds of USD to spend on Google / Instagram / Facebook ads (living in the damn third world country is not fun..)

Im just trying to find honest job, and help someone else who needs more money."
4,Does directory + blog make sense?,juststart,urfavgggirl,10,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1cub2hc/does_directory_blog_make_sense/,"I have always been curious about directories because I never see anyone talk about them in these forums, which may indicate that they are not profitable, but at the same time, if there are so many on the internet, it must be for a reason, right?

I have the idea of making a directory of, for example: 'nature camps in WA' + some typical blog posts: tips, gear, etc. Makes sense?

Through this idea, several doubts arise:
1. SEO + where to create this? I am used to blogs where you do SEO in the configuration of the web in general and then in each post. I have a system worked on for years so this part is the one that scares me the most. Also, where to create this? My first option is always Wordpress but I have no idea what limitations it has with directories (I'm currently looking for plugins).

2. Monetization. I highly doubt that directories will be viewed favorably for display ads and if it is possible, it will cost a lot to get it approved. I got the idea of monetizing different actions like 'Add your business' and 'Recommend it #1'. Also, commission or affiliate link for each business that wants to be added but I find it quite difficult to keep track of each business.

3. Legal. This is the section where I have the most doubts. My long-term goal is for businesses to be added manually by the owners, but I can't publish a directory without businesses from scratch, so my idea is to take 3 random ones from each city/neighborhood and add them manually (or through a script). My question is how legal this would be because I understand that if it is data published on Google there is no problem but... it scares me.

If anyone has any opinions or insights, I'd love to hear them! I will publish the case study month by month here if I definitely do this project :)"

TL;DR: Hey fellow entrepreneurs and webmasters! I’m working on an SEO software and I’m super curious about your experiences with similar tools. What do you love or hate about the SEO software you’ve used? Why did you pick it? I’m not looking for tips on developing the software, running a business, or marketing strategies – just your honest user experiences. Thanks in advance!
I have nothing to sell!

Hey everyone on r/juststart

I’m in the midst of creating an SEO software, and I realized something important – what better way to make something useful than to ask the people who actually use these tools? That’s why I’m here.

I’m not after advice on how to build the software (got that covered, thankfully!) nor am I here to get a lecture on the ‘do’s and don’ts’ of running a business or marketing strategies. I’m pretty clued up on how competitive this field is, so no need to go down that road.

What I really want to dive into is your raw, unfiltered experiences with SEO software. What features made you go “Wow, this is awesome!” or “Ugh, why can’t they get this right?”. Did you choose your current SEO tool because it had a killer feature, an irresistible price point, or just because it was easy to use?

I’m super curious about the real reasons you picked one software over another. Was it the analytics, the user interface, customer support, or something else entirely? And what about regrets or frustrations? Any feature you wish existed but doesn’t?

Your feedback is like gold dust for someone like me. It’s not just about building another tool; it’s about creating something that actually solves real problems and makes your entrepreneurial journey a tad easier.

So, if you’ve got a moment, I’d love to hear your thoughts. No detail is too small, and every bit of your experience (good or bad) can be incredibly enlightening.

Thanks a ton for taking the time to share your insights. It means a lot, and who knows, it might just help shape a tool that you’ll end up loving to use!

Looking forward to your responses!"

I work in a large corporate environment and we are thinking of upping our security currently.

Our current setup is Bitlocker pre boot password.

Then normal windows password and you are logged in.

We use intune and our new laptops will have faceID.

We have a mix of Windows and Macbooks. 

I have been snooping around to use YubiKey but I am facing challenges when it comes to having a passwordless experience and would like to implement a situation like the following:

Boots machine, types Bitlocker pass

On lock screen, inserts Yubi key, authenticates with WHFB or 2FA code/confirmation

I am open to any alternatives, we current have WH disabled but I could work on re-enabling. We are a high security environment and I want a high security login method without being a massive pain to login with. 

P.s Yubikey with fingerprint will be out of the question I think due to the price. 

We use MS AD also and intune.

Any assistance is greatly appreciated!

4,Troubles with my superiors at a lab,sysadmin,scantcloseness_3,5,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1ltpd4i/troubles_with_my_superiors_at_a_lab/,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I'm wondering if anyone can relate to this as a sysadmin entering the workforce at a college age. I have not had a job prior to earlier this year (freshman) after being recruited by a lab assistant leaving his workplace.

At the time of recruitment, the job seemed good enough for me as a student since it was part time and not in a corporate setting (science lab at my university). I can work almost fully remote and most of the communication is done via email and online meetings. The guy who offered it to me said it's pretty chill, consisting of web app maintenence and deployment, all done on-premises. As someone who also spends time in an OSS lab, I am well-versed in Linux server administration, containerization, virtualization, etc. so it was a good bet. I was also told I would be the only IT person there, which was probably an immediate red flag.

There were reliability issues with the on-prem server they, mind you, had for free from the OSS lab so they really wanted me to migrate it somewhere else. I tried to resolve these issues first, like installing a UPS, etc., because for some reason no one had a clue about it before me. The chairman was still dissatisfied and demanded migration to a different location. Sure, fine, we found a server at a different location. I realized that the student who worked in this position before me was not following good security and deployment practices so I had to rework the entire infra. Obviously that combined with the bureaucracy I had to go through before I even got a new server took a few months.

Then I of course had other duties such as tech maintenence, software updates, data prep, website updates, etc. in the span of around half a year (and counting). Though I have to mention that a huge chunk of it was composing emails to various departments of the university to get what the lab needed at the moment. At some point, boss was getting extremely pissy about me, thinking I'm doing my work poorly, not understanding lab goals, this that and the third. Sometimes I got blamed for everything wrong in his life, that I am hindering his work as a professor. Needless to say, however I was trying to justify myself it only aggravated him further. By then I also realized my contract was written by someone who is not tech competent so my official duties were pretty vague on paper. That along with demands to participate in events that had little to do with said duties. Oh, and even my littlest mistakes on site were brought up in emails and made me feel like shit. Coworkers who work closest with me never had a complain, though.

Anyway, my contract ends at the end of this year, and I am not extending it. Past few months have been hard on me mentally, especially with exams. I have been thinking of quitting early, but I appreciate the little money I can put on my savings account. This job made me realize no matter how competent and qualified you are for your job, you won't be appreciated enough by those who know jackshit about it."

4,Stable cpu speed on dedicated server?,sysadmin,Venisol,0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1lsdiye/stable_cpu_speed_on_dedicated_server/,"Im a developer but not very familiar with linux or hosting or cpu etc

Im running a postgres database on my server. Its AX102 on hetzner with a AMD Ryzen™ 9 7950X3D. My initial goal was to have the same performance for **query execution** on production as i have on my local machine. I am not getting confused between latency, data transfer or iops or anything. Im purely looking at postgres execution time via EXPLAIN ANALZYE.

I learned that postgres queries execute on a single thread in a single cpu. So the faster the clock speed the faster the query.

I was able to consistently and predictevly test this on my local system, shared vps and dedicated vps. (Via throttling my docker image locally).

I have a i9-13900 with 3ghz base speed in my machine.   
Queries on the vps with 2ghz cpus were exactly 33% slower.

So I bought the AX102 server with 4.2ghz base speed. The query is now 100% SLOWER than on my local machine.

With the help of claude, i fiddled around and I think the issue is that the cpus are jumping between 500mhz and 5000mhz.

I see this by running watch -n 1 ""grep MHz /proc/cpuinfo""

On the vps and my local machine its stable. I turned off powersaving mode and switched to performance.

How do I fix this issue? How do I make it stable? I read the AX series is optimized for database performance. Can you help me figure out what I'm doing wrong?

The database is created from the same dockercompose file in all systems."

# Summary

On June 21, 2025, the threat actor ""Anon-WMG"" claimed on the Exploit cybercrime forum to be selling an exploit targeting FortiGate firewalls with exposed APIs. The exploit is purported to work on FortiOS versions 7.2 and below, allowing the extraction of sensitive information such as firewall policies, VPN sessions, certificates, local users, and configuration backups. The actor claims the exploit supports multithreaded scanning and provides structured outputs in .json and .conf formats. The asking price for this exploit is $12,000.

Possible impact:  
• If unauthenticated, the exploit could dump &gt;150 configuration and status files (firewall rules, VPN sessions, certs, user DB, SNMP keys, full backups) from any Internet-facing FortiGate listening on 443 / 10443.  
• Stolen data would expose network topology, plaintext or lightly-encrypted passwords, live VPN &amp; IPSec session IDs, and SAML/RADIUS/LDAP creds, enabling lateral movement and identity spoofing deep inside victim networks.  
• Attackers could mass-scan and harvest devices with the tool’s built-in 20-thread bulk scanner, quickly building a credential trove for ransomware, espionage, or resale.  
• Price tag US $12 000 (escrow only) hints at a working 0-day; widespread adoption would parallel past FortiOS SSL-VPN exploits that seeded multiple ransomware campaigns.  
• Mitigations if no patch yet: block or ACL the API ports, disable remote admin, upgrade to the latest FortiOS (&gt; 7.2), and monitor logs for bursts of /api/v2/ requests from unfamiliar IPs.

This started in some of the Telegram channels we monitor but has now moved to more mainstream discussions. The timeline increased the conversation to 25 instances. (**edited**)

At this point, I'm providing this information as the product for sale has been verified and, if history repeats, this will follow the others, like the. Belsen Group incident.

4,MSP Lab Environment for Mentorship – Suggestions Welcome,msp,Tarirai_Nkomo,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1lpdsu5/msp_lab_environment_for_mentorship_suggestions/,"I'm currently working for an MSP, and recently, my cousin and a few of his friends (a group of 5) reached out to me for some help. They've been struggling to find work in IT, and they asked if I could mentor them or provide some real-world exposure, particularly in an MSP context, to help them build a basic understanding of how things work in the field.

We’ve agreed that I’ll be assisting them remotely ,they are currently busy with MS-900 and AZ-900. So I will start with them after they certify those two. While I initially planned to just send over training videos and resources, I realized it might be more valuable to create a hands-on lab environment with real-world scenarios.

 

 **The Plan So Far(Still in my mind)**

* I’ll set up a small lab environment that they can access from home.
* I plan to host a few internal tools (e.g., a wiki, ticketing system, etc.).
* I already have to:
   * An old Cisco ASA firewall
   * An HP server
   * Various networking equipment :1800s,1900 lol
* I also have a local AD setup already synced with Microsoft 365 (using a personal domain), complete with:
   * Group Policies (GPOs)
   * Conditional Access
   * Security baselines

 

**Hands-On Activities:**

 

I'm thinking of starting fresh and having them go through steps like:

* Installing and configuring a new Windows Server
* Setting up a new domain environment
* Syncing with Microsoft 365 (they can afford basic/premium accounts)
* Exploring Intune, teams, management on their personal devices
* Accessing the local lab network via VPN after firewall setup

This project aligns with some personal goals I had for the year, and I’m genuinely excited about it even if it involves a bit of work.

 

**What I Need Help With:**

 I'm looking for suggestions for **open-source** or **free-for-small-teams tools** (supporting at least 5 users) that replicate what’s typically used in the MSP space. Ideally, they’d get exposure to the kinds of tools they’d see in production environments.

Here are some categories I’m looking to fill:

**Credential &amp; Documentation Management**

**Professional Services Automation (PSA)**

**Remote Monitoring &amp; Management (RMM)**

**Email Security / SEG / Spam Protection-**Already have SPAM Experts

**Productivity &amp; Collaboration**\-M365 (They afford Business Prem)

**Endpoint Security &amp; Antivirus**

**Backup &amp; Disaster Recovery**

**Reporting &amp; Analytics** (M365)

**Automation &amp; Scripting** (Maybe Ansible)

**Network Monitoring &amp; Management**(PRTG)

I'm also thinking this a a great certification path:

AZ-900 &amp; MS-900

SC-900

SC-900

AZ-800

SC-300

What also frustrates me is that eventually, the code/refresh WORKS! And I get the correct output. I dont change ANYTHING in my code. I just keep refreshing it, maybe I leave it alone. Sometimes I delete and re-paste the line of code. Sometimes I delete and repaste the tab name in the files. But nothing actually changes. And the code eventually just works.

I have this laid out (shown in the image below) so there is a column for the day of the week, date the data was obtained, hour of the day the data was obtained (ie. for ""0:00"" the result will be all the vehicles counted from 0:00:00hrs - 0:59:59hrs), then the number of the detector (this set of data in particular has 8 detectors, other sets of data could have differing numbers of detectors. Each of the values then listed are the total amount of vehicles that detector counted for that specific hour on that day). There are 2904 rows of data (excluding the header row).

I need to average the data for each detector for each hour of each day of the week, if that makes sense? For example, traffic data collected by detector 1 for every Monday at 0:00hrs needs to be averaged, then data collected by detector 1 for every Monday at 1:00hrs, 2:00hrs etc etc all the way to data collected by detector 8 for every Sunday at 23:00hrs.

I put the filters on to see if I can figure a formula out but I am stuck. Existing templates/collated data only cater for a single weeks range and average using the specific cell locations, which will take me hours to pick out from thousands of rows of data, so I am attempting to create a new template to save myself and my coworkers from having to figure this out all over again.

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. Please let me know if I need to provide any more info to help with solving this issue."
4,Social Media Automation tools,automation,Select-Recording841,2,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1lt88nf/social_media_automation_tools/,"Hey everyone,

I’m looking for a **cost-effective and reliable social media automation tool** that can handle posting to multiple platforms (like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, etc.) at the same time. There are so many options out there—Buffer, Hootsuite, SocialBee, SocialPilot, Sendible, and more—that it’s tough to figure out which one actually delivers the best value for money **without sacrificing reliability or essential features**.

* Which tool are you currently using, and how much are you paying?
* Have you experienced any major issues (missed posts, glitches, poor support)?
* How easy is it to set up bulk scheduling or evergreen/recycled posts?
* Any hidden costs or limitations I should be aware of?

**From what I’ve researched so far:**

* **SocialBee** is often recommended as the best overall for automation and is pretty affordable, with strong AI features for scheduling and content recycling.
* **Buffer** is praised for its simplicity and has a decent free plan, but the paid plan is $6/month per channel, which can add up if you have a lot of accounts.
* **SocialPilot** and **Sendible** are also mentioned as affordable options, especially for agencies or those managing multiple clients.
* **Hootsuite** and **Sprout Social** seem powerful but get pricey fast, especially for small businesses or solo creators.

Would love to hear your real-world experiences—especially if you’ve switched from one tool to another for cost or reliability reasons. Any underrated tools worth checking out?

Thanks!"

For those of you offering n8n or similar automation services how are you finding your clients?

-Are there specific communities or platforms you recommend?
-Do you rely on cold outreach, referrals, Upwork/Fiverr, Reddit, etc.?
-Any tips on how to market yourself specifically as an n8n expert?

Most of us keep doing the same thing:
Dropping links to our automations &amp; agents in Facebook groups, Reddit threads, Discord…
But think about it — everyone there is a builder too.
No wonder there’s barely any real buying.

That approach? Done. Over.

So I’ve been heads‑down lately building two big projects — and this is one of them:
Axon:
✅ A real marketplace for AI agents &amp; automations
✅ Builders get a storefront &amp; ranking, not just random posts
✅ Clients get to discover, buy, and request what they need
✅ Planned: analytics, drag‑and‑drop customization, and more

It’s raw &amp; early — but the waitlist is open:

We’re just getting started. And what’s coming next is even bigger."

* Uses OCR + AI to extract parties, case number, court, dates, and legal citations
* GPT-4 drafts a full legal response (e.g., motion to dismiss)
* Checks case law via CourtListener and includes relevant precedent
* Sends for lawyer approval, then auto-routes to **DocuSign** for signing
* Files everything to Google Drive and logs the case in Airtable

It saves the firm hours per case and helps them scale faster.

Need help with a somewhat advanced workflow, not sure where to send this to so posting here. I'm looking to do the following:

Input a variable to somewhere and get a Return of different variables that I specified, each with a name and a value, that would fit into other steps in the workflow.

&amp;#x200B;

So for example, it would work as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

INPUT I pass from Workflow: GroceryList01

&amp;#x200B;

OUTPUT returned to workflow:

Dairy01: Milk

Veggies01: Broccoli

Veggies02: Carrots

&amp;#x200B;

Or in another instance, if the input was let's say: GroceryList02

&amp;#x200B;

Output would be:

Dairy01: Yogurt

Veggies01: Radish

Veggies02: Zucchini

&amp;#x200B;

The output values would be pre-determined by me (i.e. Dairy01, Veggies01, Veggies02 are pre-determined variable names with fixed values they'd return based on the specific input).

&amp;#x200B;

I would use whatever the output returns for Dairy01, Veggies01, Veggies02 in future steps in the workflow.

The 1st &amp; 2nd photos show my dining room and entry hall. You basically walk right into my dining room since there’s no hallway. My husband tends to use my dining chairs as his personal closet so I bought him a drying rack. It’s not very nice to look at but if I move it into a different room, he will go back to hanging things on the chairs. He is a swimmer and is hyper sensitive to mold, so he dries all his towels and flip flops on the rack. We also have shopping carts in this corner but sometimes those go in the car so they’re not always out.

Any suggestions on what I can do here?

I do have a coat hanger on the opposite side of the entry door, but that is filled with coats &amp; bags.

4,Garage Organizing Methodology,organization,jeffwithajee2,49,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/organization/comments/14siut6/garage_organizing_methodology/,"I have a small side business helping people with organizing their garages.

I just updated my website with a page that explains my methodology for how to organize your own garage.  You can check it out here: [https://www.mygaragedesign.com/organizing-methodology](https://www.mygaragedesign.com/organizing-methodology)

I'd love some feedback.  I used Microsoft Bing's Image Creator for the images.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the text only of the steps:

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 1)** *First things first.  Get some good snacks, drinks, and music to listen to.*

**Step 2)** *On a notepad write down a list of 5 or so goals you have with organizing your garage.*

*1. Dust the cobwebs*

*2. Organize my power tools*

*3. Create a battery charging station*

*4. Have an open workspace*

*5. Get a pegboard on a wall to use to organize my garden tools*

*Etc.*

**Step 3)** *Keep this list near you at all times. Throughout the sorting process, you will most likely be coming up with ideas to better organize your items, such as buying small bins to put your screws and nails, or maybe you need more boxes to hold your paint supplies.  Whenever you come up with an idea add it to your goal list.* 

**Step 4)** *If you can, dedicate a clear space in your driveway to use as a sorting space, preferably your entire driveway*

**Step 5)** *Move your trash bin and recycle bin to an easily assessable area in your sorting area.*

**Step 6)** *Designate where you want items in your garage to go.* 

*1. Garden tools*

*2. Car maintenance*

*3. Food storage*

*4. Cleaning supplies*

*5. Pile of items to bring somewhere else, like the yard or house*

*Etc.*

**NOTE)** *Every time you pick up an item to sort it, you will be asking yourself the question “Do I want to keep this?” If yes, then you will put it in the appropriate area.  If the answer is no, then it goes into 1 of 3 places on your driveway: in the trash, in the recycling, or in a pile of items to give away.*

**Step 7)** *Now you are ready to start organizing items.  First, we are going to manage larger items. If you have boxes and containers with smaller items inside them that need sorting (such as a container with different screws and nails that need to be sorted) put these containers in a designated area on your driveway.  You will organize each of these containers later.*

*For large items such as boxes of Christmas lights, rakes, ladders, ect., move these to the area that you have designated them to go (where you want them to be when your garage is completely organized). This process may be slow, but the key is not to spend too much time thinking about an individual item.  Give yourself* ***30-60 seconds*** *to come up with a decision for each item.  Hopefully, it takes only a few seconds to decide for most items.*

**Step 8)** *Once you are completed with the larger items it's time to move the smaller items into their places such as paint cans, small hand tools, duct tape, etc.  Organize these items into their appropriate location.*

**Step 9)** *Look through your goal list to see if you can do any small goals right away without needing to leave your home.*

**STEP 10)** *Give away all the items in your giveaway pile.*

**Step 11)** *One by one organize all the boxes and containers with smaller items inside them that need sorting.  These containers should be sorted out one at a time so that you can stay focused on each one as a separate goal.*

Once you are completed with this step you should have all of your garage organized.  **Congratulations!!**"

At first, we sent everyone a template to copy and paste. That worked for a week, but then people started tweaking things or forgetting to update their info. We needed something easier and more scalable.

Eventually, we moved to a tool that integrates with Gmail and lets us apply the same HTML signature to everyone through Google Workspace. Now if we change something like the support number or run a short promo, we can update it for the whole team in one go.

We’ve been using [this](https://www.bybrand.io/integrations/workspace) for a few months now and it’s been a big relief.

4,Zoho vs HubSpot for B2B fintech CRM,CRM,FickleGenie,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRM/comments/1lls3ve/zoho_vs_hubspot_for_b2b_fintech_crm/,"Hey guys,

We’re in the process of choosing a CRM system and could use some honest input. Our business has been growing steadily and it’s time to finally put structure around our sales and marketing.

A bit of context: we’re a B2B fintech working in a regulated, high-risk space (crypto, iGaming, PSPs). Around 40 people in the team. I’m in marketing, but the CRM has to be great for sales — they’re going to be the power users.

Right now, we’re stuck between Zoho and HubSpot. Reviews are all over the place, and while price isn’t a dealbreaker, we don’t want to overpay for features we won’t use. If we can save money and still scale smoothly, great.

Here’s what we’re looking for:

Sales needs:

* Deal pipeline and sales activity tracking
* Easy team collaboration and task assignment
* Custom lifecycle stages
* Reminders, follow-ups, notes that don’t disappear
* Clean mobile UX

Marketing needs:

* Marketing automation
* Email campaigns and newsletters
* SQL/MQL tracking
* Lead scoring and segmentation
* Ad platform integrations (Google Ads, LinkedIn)
* Analytics and attribution tracking
* GDPR-friendly email consent flows

We’ve looked at Salesforce, Pipedrive, Insightly, ActiveCampaign, and EngageBay too. Either they felt too clunky, too limited, or like too much of a stretch for our needs.

If you’ve used Zoho or HubSpot (or anything else amazing for this kind of setup), what did you love or hate?

Did anything catch you by surprise after implementation?  
Would you recommend one over the other for a small team that’s moving fast and wants to keep things clear and collaborative?

We recently started using a system from [www.fieldboss.com](https://www.fieldboss.com/) that’s built on Microsoft Dynamics, and honestly, it’s been a lot more aligned with our workflow compared to generic CRMs we’ve tried in the past.

It handles scheduling, dispatch, service history, and even recurring maintenance in one place. Still figuring out some of the deeper customization features, but so far it's helped reduce double-entry and made communication between the office and field techs smoother. Anyone else here in field services using a CRM that’s worked well? Would love to compare notes or hear what you’ve found useful."

I’m looking for a good personal CRM, mainly to help me keep track of my professional network, follow-ups, key conversations, and important relationships.

Ideally something that:
* Is more relationship-focused (not just sales pipeline)

* Isn’t too heavy or complicated to maintain

I run a B2B marketplace and we're actively building relationships with potential users and partnership prospects. 

LinkedIn is our main engagement channel, as that’s where our audience lives.

I'm looking for a tool that can:

* Help manage outreach (connection requests, messages, follow-ups)
* Track relationship status and outreach history
* Organize contacts into a pipeline (e.g., outreach → follow-up → demo booked → onboarded)
* Ideally integrate with or overlay LinkedIn, since that’s where most of our interactions happen

Any suggestions for tools that work well for this kind of workflow? 

Open to CRM solutions, Chrome extensions, or dedicated LinkedIn tools.

We are considering down sizing...not due to money but due to the fact that we want a pool and to be closer to 6yo friends.   We are 45 and 36.

Current home:
3600 sqft, 6 bed 4 bath.  Finished basement with living room.  Huge yard.  Have 200k in equity.  Very nice neighborhood but boring.  Mainly older ish crowd.  Sunsetting but not retired...this is a thing.  No kids in the neighborhood or others our age.  Have incredible views and homes are on big lots so no close neighbors.  Massive living room with 25' ceiling. 

Potential home:
2400 sqft. 5bed 3 bath.  In middle of social zone, amazing pool, amazing back yard with pergola- outdoor living area.  Very little yard.  

Pros of moving is obviously the pool and back yard, smaller yard so less upkeep, smaller house payment.  Closer to her friends.  More social area 
Cons of moving: smaller house, less living space. 

We arent lake river people.  Give me a heated saltwater pool all day long over a boat and a lake.  We would be about 1200-1500 less per month on a house payment.  Less property tax if we leave also.  

6yo and junior stay in same school dist either way.

4,"Missouri mechanic shop doubled their quote, did unsafe work, and sent me out with missing parts. Do I have grounds to take legal action?",legaladvice,ZippermanDan,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1luc7qw/missouri_mechanic_shop_doubled_their_quote_did/,"**Location: Missouri**

A couple weeks ago I was stuck out of town and needed urgent front-end work done on my truck. I had the parts with me but didn’t have time to do the work myself. I called a local shop, explained the situation, and they told me to bring it in the next morning. Over the phone, they quoted me **$470 to install the parts and do an alignment.**

The next morning I found out my grandmother (who I live with and help care for) was rushed to the ICU. I asked the shop if the work could be done the same day and they said yes. I dropped it off at 10:30 AM.

Around noon, they called and said one bolt was seized and might need to be replaced. They said if they had to order the part, the cost would be **around $700.** I told them clearly: let me know **before** ordering or doing anything extra. They said okay.

At 3 PM I hadn’t heard anything, so I called. They told me they’d already ordered the part and it wouldn’t be done until the next day. I was frustrated, but I let it go. I asked **again** whether the price would go up, and was told no they had looked over everything and there would be **no additional charges.** I emphasized again, please let me know **if anything changes.**

The next day I still hadn’t heard anything, so I called again. They told me it would be ready in an hour but also said the price was now **another $150 higher.** I was obviously upset, but I needed to get home. When I arrived, a police officer was randomly parked out front (not sure if that was related), and the shop owner/receptionist handed me a bill for **over $1,000.** More than double the original quote.

My father-in-law, who was with me, questioned the massive price jump. The woman immediately told us to “pay the bill and leave,” and said, *“If you want trouble, I got trouble for you.”* I tried to explain the situation with my grandmother and she cut me off with, *“Yeah yeah, grandma’s in the hospital, we get that all the time.”* I was shocked by how rude and aggressive she was, but I paid just to leave.

**Here’s the worst part:**  
A week later, I took the truck to my regular mechanic. He was blown away by the poor quality of the work. He found that **they didn’t even bolt on one of the ball joints** and they never did the alignment they charged me for. My brand new tires were already worn to the wires on the inside edge after less than a month. He told me to they did not have a leg to stand on and said the shop had screwed me over bad. They pretty much put my own, and my family's life in danger. I drove over 100 miles with my vehicle like this at highway speeds. 

I’ve since looked at their reviews and have seen multiple reviews reporting similar.. inflated bills and unauthorized work.

I’m considering my options. Possibly small claims court or even a consumer protection lawsuit under Missouri’s Merchandising Practices Act.

**My main questions:**

* Would this be worth pursuing legally, or is it just a “he said/she said” situation?
* Would small claims court in Missouri be the best route?
* Has anyone successfully handled something similar?
* What evidence would help the most (I have photos, receipts, a written statement from my mechanic, and tire damage)?
* Should I also report them to the MO Attorney General or BBB?

Thanks for reading and I’d really appreciate any advice from mechanics, attorneys, or anyone who's been through something similar."

However it occured to me the premises will lay dormant much of the time. There is a massive demand for decent commercial kitchen spaces (I know this because it took us over a year to find something suitable and affordable) and all the agents we spoke to said the same thing. 

I was then thinking I would like to pivot to offer a shared kitchen workspace monthly fee perhaps 3 months commitment. In return you'd get support with meeting food safety, security, access to equipment, a selected number of power sockets for your own equipment, a dedicated mailbox etc. 

Has anyone else done something like this? It's practically a dark kitchen but for smaller starting up scale food businesses. Is this a terrible idea (UK based) that you've tried and failed to make an impact with? If so why?

Any thoughts, feedback welcome!

As someone juggling a million things, one of my biggest struggles has been consistently creating content without burning out. Staring at a blank screen every day is draining.

I've been experimenting with AI to build better workflows, and I landed on this ""Content Multiplier"" prompt that's been a game-changer for me. Instead of just asking for a single post, it turns one core idea into a whole campaign.

I thought I'd share it here in case it helps anyone else.

**The Workflow:**

You just give this prompt to your AI of choice (I use Gemini, but ChatGPT, etc., works too).

    Act as my expert content strategist.
    My core idea is [Your Topic Here].
    Based on this idea, generate the following:
    1. A compelling title for a blog post.
    2. A LinkedIn post explaining the core concept.
    3. A 5-tweet thread that breaks the idea down.

**How it works in practice:**

For example, I'll take a simple idea like **""the benefits of AI for small business""** and put it in the \[Your Topic Here\] section.

Instantly, I get a great blog title, a full-length LinkedIn post, and a 5-part Twitter thread that I can schedule out over several days. It saves a ton of time on brainstorming and formatting.

Hope this is useful for some of you. What are some other simple but powerful AI workflows you've been using? Would be cool to learn more."

Fathom Analytics, Switched from Google Analytics and haven’t looked back. Super simple, privacy-focused, and gives just the right amount of insight without overwhelming charts.

Customerly, Handles live chat, email automations, and even surveys. We’re not a huge team, so having all customer support + onboarding communication in one place has been a game changer.

Notion, We use it for internal docs, task tracking, and even lightweight CRM stuff. Probably overkill for some, but it keeps our small team aligned.

Paddle, Made billing and taxes way less painful. If you’re selling internationally, especially in the EU, this handles all the compliance stuff for you."

How We Got Here (and Why AI Isn’t Saving Us Yet),productivity,coolandy00,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1lrppy4/dev_productivity_61_chaos_repetition_how_we_got/,"We recently ran a retro on dev workflows in our startup and what surfaced wasn’t pretty.

For some time, our devs operated in full-on chaos mode. No single source of truth. Requirements in Excel, decisions in Slack threads, diagrams in PowerPoint (yes, really). Before anyone could code, they’d burn hours just trying to find context. It wasn’t ""flow state""; it was scavenger hunt mode.

Once they got to code, it was rinse and repeat. Searching for boilerplate, wiring up basic scaffolds, testing stubs, etc. The creative part of building something? It came after digging through the rubble.

So we introduced tools to somewhat fix it:

- Notion to organize specs and reduce context-switching.
- GitHub Copilot to accelerate routine coding.

Small wins but here’s the kicker: after measuring time saved, we found it only cut 5-10% of the effort.

However, nearly half of dev workload is still taken up by chaos + repetition.

Meanwhile, business processes at corporates are automated to save costs. But half of us devs are still doing things manually because:

- AI tools don’t yet follow dev rhythm
- Prompting feels like babysitting a bot
- Code output is often too unreliable for production
- Chaos management (docs, specs, decisions) is still...human-heavy

Feels like the wrong people are getting the automation superpowers.

Is this just part of the journey, or do we need an entirely new way to work? Curious if anyone else here feels this same friction and sees the same gap. "

The idea is simple — there's already a growing demand for roasted makhana in India (especially as a healthy snack), and I’ve seen solid interest from outside India too — places like the UAE, US, UK, and even Southeast Asia. So we’ve decided to focus on B2B — either bulk sales in India or export.

Right now, I’m trying to connect with:

* Exporters or brands looking for private label products
* Anyone in the health food space looking to source roasted makhana in bulk

We’ve already set up the machinery and packaging — we just need the right buyers now. I’m honestly new to the B2B/export world, so I’d love any guidance:

* Are there any **specific portals or websites** where I can list this?
* Any **communities or events** where people in this space hang out?

3,When System Fails Honest Merchants,business,Jeypeter,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1lq74ir/when_system_fails_honest_merchants/,"I recently came across a post from a small business owner that resonated deeply with me. It was a heartfelt message that perfectly encapsulates a significant challenge many online businesses face: unjust chargebacks.

The post described a situation where a customer placed a substantial order, engaged in extensive email communication, and then, months later, filed a false chargeback claiming an unauthorized purchase. Despite the business owner providing overwhelming evidence, including emails, shipping confirmation, and proof of delivery, the customer's bank sided with the cardholder after what appeared to be a minimal investigation. Essentially, the bank's decision facilitated a form of theft.

Unfortunately, this story is not uncommon. In the payment processing industry, I've witnessed numerous small businesses experience similar issues. Even when merchants provide excellent service, have proof of delivery, and maintain clear communication, the odds in a chargeback dispute are often stacked against them. Banks are primarily incentivized to protect cardholders, not merchants. This often leads to insufficient investigation and an imbalanced weighing of evidence. As a result, legitimate businesses lose money, sometimes hundreds or thousands of dollars, and their accounts can even be terminated without warning due to ""excessive chargebacks.

The most frustrating aspect is the lack of accountability; the current system often allows bad actors to exploit chargebacks with minimal consequences.

I wanted to share this story to shed light on the harsh reality faced by many small online stores. It's not just about the financial loss; it's also the emotional burden of being scammed, having done everything correctly, and still losing out. If you run a small online business and have experienced this, please know you are not alone.

This is a challenging issue with no simple solutions. My hope in sharing this is to ensure others feel understood and, perhaps, collectively push for fairer processes in the future."

* Store promos
* Credit card offers
* Platform-wide discounts
* Gift card savings

# The Unexpected Discovery

During our alpha testing with under 2 dozen users, something interesting emerged:

* People really liked the tool for Grocery, although Uber Eats and Doordash were on there and I assumed those are mainly restaurant-focused apps and audiences.
* Users built 35% larger carts when using our optimization tools
* But here's the kicker: **Users were equally interested in in-store discounts.**

This last point completely shifted our strategy.

# The Dilemma

Now I'm facing a classic startup problem. I need proof that my app works to get partnerships, but to get partnerships for my app to work I need partnerships.

So here's where I'm at:

**Option A - The chicken:** Pull back from technical/dev work and try to network. Focus on trying to land my first in-store grocery partner. After I get that, integrate the partner into the app and launch a targeted SMM blitz to get my ICP shopping. On the backend, I try a few founder events and coffee chats. Then, reintroduce myself to delivery platforms and work out partnerships with major platforms, dominate that vertical.

**Option B - The egg:** Stick to delivery platforms. Build a comprehensive food savings platform that works for delivery - but since I won't have access to partner platforms, it will be compromised. I can't get real time pricing and I can't get merchant-specific deals. I'm opening myself up to legal risk if these companies don't like it, but the hope would be that I have just enough time to present them KPIs that show greater costs and much higher intent for carts.

I need both user interest and business partnerships to make this work. Solve the chicken-and-egg problem or risk everything on an unproven bet?

For option A, I would only be able to offer my service to people in small areas I can service. That limits my addressable users significantly and introduces a core issue: __how do you land a grocery partner without a proven track record?__

For option B, I run a major risk of legal issues, and I launch a compromised version of my core product. However, my TAM would be nationwide and then its all about getting as much attention from anywhere at all. This idea is sort of like Leetcode's launch (which later became Cluely). 


## The Real Question
Is it better to own one vertical completely or address the full customer journey? Is this one of those moments where you follow the users even if it complicates everything?

I know there's no right answer, but curious how others have navigated similar crossroads.

3,Did launching too early ever ruin your startup? I will not promote,startups,cristinon,8,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1lsne33/did_launching_too_early_ever_ruin_your_startup_i/,"I’ve always heard “launch fast, fail fast,” but I only think that works for brand new tools.

There are many products that have been very successful because they are experiences and not just another tool.

What if Duolingo had launched as just a multiple choice quiz? They definitely wouldn’t have been Rosetta Stone. The value came the experience: streaks, gamification, the cartoon bird that gets sad when you don’t use it.

Same with Notion, if it had just been another markdown editor no one would care, but instead they focused on the aesthetic and easy to use building blocks.

Even Dropbox, another complex file server would have been ignored, so they took the time to build an easy to use drag and drop tool.

I’ve currently spent months, and have written thousands of lines of code for the productivity tool that I am building. I could have launched in a week if I just copied all the other tools that are out there, but instead I want to build an experience, and a startup with an identity.

My tool is self-hosted, private, very simple to use, and has an intuitive workflow. All of this fundamentally changes what the product is. It defines my product’s values. I still have a lot to figure out from user feedback, but I’m much happier with what I have now than if I had launched faster.

Has anyone here ever launched too early, and later realized it killed the product’s potential?
Or the opposite, waited too long and missed the window?"

3,Anyone into AI vibe coding?,Solopreneur,66north66,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Solopreneur/comments/1ltzouk/anyone_into_ai_vibe_coding/,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been messing around with AI code tools for a while now, and I think I’m not the only “vibe-coder” out there who’s super excited by the idea of building an app without a dev, but keeps hitting walls right before the finish line.

The dream of a life without needing an actual developer isn’t here yet, but it feels like we’re getting closer every day. I’ve hit that “so close… but ugh” moment a few times, and finally begged a senior dev friend of mine for help to wrap things up. We starting discussion the size of this issue and it seems from reading through this and other subreddits that I'm not the only one experiencing this.  
We discussed if this might be a business idea, so I wanted to get yous'alls feedback.

I’m curious:

1. For the non-coders here, what kinds of issues do you typically run into when you’re almost done?
2. What would you most like help with - bug fixes, polishing UI, deployment, integration stuff, etc.?
3. Would you pay someone to help you push your project live? If so, ballpark how much?

I’m trying to figure out if there’s a real need (and a market) for a service that specializes in helping “vibe-coders” cross that finish line. Any thoughts or feedback would be awesome!"

Ever since college, I used to ruined my day by oversleeping and struggled to build good habits.

So I made this app to solve my own problem.

When I actually used it myself, it worked quite well, so I believed others would like it too.

But trying to promote my app, It is much more harder than I thought.

I tired posting in related subreddits and ran paid marketing, but the results didn't seem promising.

ASO is definitely important, but since there are already many apps with 1 million or 100,000 downloads ranking high for relevant keywords, my app only appears far down after a lot of scrolling. So I’m not sure if constantly tweaking the app description and screenshots is actually effective.

Or maybe the real issue is that the app itself just isn’t appealing enough?

Trying to gain users one by one is exhausting.

Have any of you gone through something like this?

I’d love to hear how you managed to break through this phase."

if you’re reading this, you’ve probably thought about starting something on your own, maybe already did, maybe still trying. we’re the same. we know the problems we go through aren’t unique. thousands of people out there are going through the same stuff, and that’s what keeps us going – trying to fix those problems

like a lot of devs we were always more comfortable building the product. the hard part was marketing. but now we finally built something to fix that too, for us and for people like us

before, we used to promote our stuff by just posting on social media. it didn’t really work. we never got the kind of conversion we wanted and eventually we gave up on pushing too hard. then we started making TikTok content about our product and out of nowhere the numbers blew up. we were finally seeing some results. but creating content all the time gets exhausting fast, especially when you’re also the one building everything

so we built something to help with that

I'm a solo dev running a small SaaS, and I was constantly losing money due to failed Stripe payments.

Stripe does send automatic emails, but they’re generic, unbranded, and honestly... I had zero visibility on who’s active, who’s on a trial, who just failed a payment, or who’s about to churn.

So I built SublyOne — a lightweight tool that gives you:

a clear dashboard of your subscriptions (trials, active users, failed payments),

customizable retry emails (with your own branding and message),

a simple client portal so your users can update their credit cards easily.

💸 Idea: recover hundreds of dollars a month without touching code.
I’m looking for 10 early testers (free access for feedback).
If you’re a SaaS founder or indie dev and this sounds useful, drop a comment or DM me.

Also would love your feedback:
Do you actually face this issue?
Would you pay $15–$30/month for it?
Are you using anything similar right now?

3,How do you connect your daily grind to your 10-year vision? (Sanity check on a tool I'm building),Solopreneur,S7012MY,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Solopreneur/comments/1lqwgzd/how_do_you_connect_your_daily_grind_to_your/,"Hey everyone,

I've been wrestling with a problem lately and I'm genuinely curious if it's just me, or if other founders feel this too.

I have a huge, ambitious 10-year vision for my business. I know the ""what"" and the ""why."" The problem is the ""how"" on a day-to-day basis. My daily reality is a storm of urgent emails, client demands, putting out fires, and a to-do list that feels more like a dumping ground for random thoughts than a strategic plan.

At the end of the day, I'm exhausted and I've been *busy*, but I often have this nagging feeling that I didn't actually move the needle on the big goals. I'm stuck in the ""tyranny of the urgent,"" and my long-term vision feels like it's getting further away.

I've tried all the standard productivity apps, but they mostly just feel like prettier lists of the same chaotic tasks. They don't help me answer the fundamental question: ""Of the 20 things I *could* do right now, what is the #1 thing I *should* do to get closer to my ultimate goal?""

So, I started building a tool for myself to fix this. The core idea is an AI strategist that does the following:

1. **Works backward from the big vision:** I tell it my 10-year goal, and it breaks it down into measurable yearly milestones, monthly objectives, weekly targets, and finally, a prioritized list of daily tasks.
2. **Prioritizes the day for me:** It looks at my goals and any urgent calendar events and tells me, ""This is your most important task today.""
3. **Makes input effortless:** I'm often not at my desk when I have an idea, so I built it around voice input. I can just talk to it and it captures the task without me having to stop what I'm doing.
4. **Keeps me honest:** I even added a little AI accountability coach that checks in to make sure I'm not procrastinating on the important stuff.

So, my question to you all is: **Am I just building this for myself, or does this problem resonate with anyone else?**

How are you currently bridging that massive gap between your day-to-day chaos and your huge, long-term ambitions? Are you using a specific system, a combination of tools, or just sheer force of will?

Any feedback on the concept would be amazing.

Thanks!!!

P.S. I put up a super simple landing page to track my progress and see if other people were interested in the idea. If you want to see a more polished version of what I'm talking about, it's at [https://nup.it.com](https://nup.it.com)

No pressure at all, I'm mostly just looking for feedback on the idea itself here."

It's been just over a month since I launched my little SAAS — and I'm genuinely excited to say:

We just hit 202 registered users! 🎉

It might not sound massive in the world of viral launches, but to me, it's a huge deal. Every single user feels like a real vote of confidence. Especially because I started this journey with zero expectations — and that mindset helped me stay consistent and avoid burnout.

Quick Stats Recap (Month 1):

5,890 unique visitors

426,226 page hits (≈ 49.5 Hits/Visit)

$90 revenue earned

96 products launched by makers

33 clicks from 528 SEO impressions

202 users signed in

What I’m Working on:

Currently building the Android app, just waiting for Google to approve. My hope is that this will make discovery + product testing smoother for new users on mobile.

Still focusing on product visibility. Every single signup is a small celebration 🎉

Why I’m Posting:

Growing a SaaS is hard. Behind every product, there's usually a solo founder or small team juggling code, design, support, and trying to stay motivated. And let’s be honest — marketing often gets pushed to the side. We spend weeks (or months) building something we care about, but when it’s time to promote, it feels overwhelming or awkward. That’s the reality for many of us.

If you’ve got 5 minutes, consider submitting your project to www.justgotfound.com —
Even 5 new users or testers could be a game-changer for you. It’s free. And as they say:

""Every little bit of publicity is good publicity.""

Thanks again for all the support so far — and let’s keep building!
I'll try to keep updates coming as the journey continues 💪"
3,Startup Fundraising Is Rigged. Here's How I Beat It With No Degree And No Network As A Solo Founder,Solopreneur,EmilianoLGU,3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Solopreneur/comments/1lp7mq6/startup_fundraising_is_rigged_heres_how_i_beat_it/,"Here’s the truth.

**Fundraising is rigged.**

If you didn’t go to Stanford or an Ivy League college and don’t have co-founders most investors simply don’t believe in you.

They’ll say they do. They’ll say they “back misfits.” But when you look at their portfolio it’s the same old story. Harvard graduate, MIT graduate, etc.

Here’s the brutal truth: VCs love to use Ivy League degrees as an IQ filter and almost exclusively fund teams of 2-4 founders.

The typical founder? Attends a Tier 1 university and decides to “startup” with their college roommate.

They build nothing. No product, no customers. Not even a clear idea.

Yet gets into a program like YC and gets a massive “pre-seed” investment of $500k-$2M.

Product? Idea? That comes *after* the money hits their bank account.

That’s wasn’t me. That’s not most solo founders, especially if you’re reading this.

I was the Emo kid in high school blasting Kanye, skipping class, and flipping electronics online.

I never graduated college. Never worked at Google (or for anyone for that matter).

Still, I raised money from Jason Calacanis, one of the most prominent angel investors of all time (3rd/4th investor in Uber and one of the first investors in Robinhood).

Without any degree. Without any network. Without any co-founders.

**Here is how I did it.**

⸻

**Step 1: Build a Beautiful Product** 

Stop talking. Ship something real.

Your product must be:

• **Real.** Functional and live

• **Beautiful.** Polished enough to impress users

This shows investors you’re not just a talker. You are a doer who can actually build.

You don’t need a fancy resume. Or a degree. Just a beautiful product to PROVE you can build.

⸻

💵 **Step 2: Sell It (Even If It’s One Customer)**

A product is meaningless if no one will pay for it.

Most founders think “if I build a good product, they will come.”

Nope. This is not how the world works.

Look around.

If you don't see any salespeople, you're the salesperson.

You need:

• A handful of paying customers

• Clear, documented feedback

• Real revenue (not a forecast)

Within 1 week of launching Rivin AI I had a full calendar of sales calls, a handful of Walmart sellers paying to analyze Walmart sales data, and customers giving me product feedback. They paid me. That’s traction.

⸻

**Step 3: The Secret Weapon? Pretend They’ve Already Invested**

This is the game‑changer.

The step that most founders skip: Instead of waiting to “be ready” and then *pitching*, **start by sending updates**.

Here’s how I did it:

1. Curated a list of 50+ investors I respected

2. Sent **weekly product updates** and **monthly financial snapshots**

3. Shared:

* What I built that week
* Monthly MRR, burn rate, cash on hand, and MoM growth

**Crucially: I never EVER asked for money.**  
**I just acted like they were already invested.**

👉 After a few weeks? This happened:

“Wait. Have we invested in your company? These updates are 🔥”

Exactly the reaction I wanted.

That’s how I landed Jason Calacanis’ firm to invest in my startup. There were no “VC lunches”, I never asked for money, and I don’t even think had a pitch deck.

Just undeniable traction and momentum.

That’s the secret.

⸻

💡 **Why This Works**

If you don’t have an Ivy League degree, you need to prove yourself:

1. Build = Show you can build something beautiful
2. Sell = Prove your product is needed by closing real customers
3. Update = Be disciplined and transparent

———

You don’t need:

* An Ivy League degree
* A network
* Demo day
* A polished pitch deck

You do need:

* A working, polished product
* Real customers
* Regular, disciplined updates
* Relentless follow‑through

⸻

That was the story of how I raised initial investment for my startup.

For context, my startup Rivin builds software for Walmart sellers. Sharing this because I understand that for each founders the fundraising process may be different.

If you’re in pure software(like me!) I highly recommend following my fundraising strategy but if you are in hardware or deep tech you’ll probably have to change your raising strategy to align with your product development milestones since the development curve is a LOT longer for founders in those arenas.

Hope this helps you out! Let me know if you’d like me to share my exact email templates in another post. This one is long a bit long as is haha"
3,Reasoning models are risky. Anyone else experiencing this?,Solopreneur,interviuu,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Solopreneur/comments/1lp2jrk/reasoning_models_are_risky_anyone_else/,"I'm building a job application tool and have been testing pretty much every LLM model out there for different parts of the product. One thing that's been driving me crazy: reasoning models seem particularly dangerous for business applications that need to go from A to B in a somewhat rigid way.

I wouldn't call it ""deterministic output"" because that's not really what LLMs do, but there are definitely use cases where you need a certain level of consistency and predictability, you know?

Here's what I keep running into with reasoning models:

During the reasoning process (and I know Anthropic has shown that what we read isn't the ""real"" reasoning happening), the LLM tends to ignore guardrails and specific instructions I've put in the prompt. The output becomes way more unpredictable than I need it to be.

Sure, I can define the format with JSON schemas (or objects) and that works fine. But the actual content? It's all over the place. Sometimes it follows my business rules perfectly, other times it just doesn't. And there's no clear pattern I can identify.

For example, I need the model to extract specific information from resumes and job posts, then match them according to pretty clear criteria. With regular models, I get consistent behavior most of the time. With reasoning models, it's like they get ""creative"" during their internal reasoning and decide my rules are more like suggestions.

I've tested almost all of them (from Gemini to DeepSeek) and honestly, none have convinced me for this type of structured business logic. They're incredible for complex problem-solving, but for ""follow these specific steps and don't deviate"" tasks? Not so much.

Anyone else dealing with this? Am I missing something in my prompting approach, or is this just the trade-off we make with reasoning models? I'm curious if others have found ways to make them more reliable for business applications.

What's been your experience with reasoning models in production?"

so a few months back, we noticed something weird

clients suddenly started saying:

“i found you guys on chatgpt, Grok suggested me, AI recommended me”

and that’s when it clicked.

Our team then updated our calendar page with AI option 2 months ago, and we were shocked to see 30% of the people who scheduled a meeting put ""AI recommended"" option.

AI search is the new SEO, we at Offshore Wolf gave it a fancy name, we call it LMO - Language Model Optimization, nobody's talking about it yet, so just wanted to share what we changed to rank.

here’s how we started ranking across *all* the big LLMs: chatgpt, claude, grok

\#1 We started contributing on communities

Every like, comment, share, links to our website increased the number of meetings we get from AI SEO,

so we heavily started contributing on platforms like quora, reddit, medium and the result? Way more organic meetings - all for free.

\#2 We wrote content like we were talking to AI

* clear descriptions of what we do
* mentioned our brand + keywords in natural language
* added tons of Q&amp;A-style content (like FAQs, but smarter)
* gave context LLMs can latch onto: who we help, what we solve, how we’re different

\#3 we posted content designed for AI memory

we used to post for humans scrolling.

now we post for AI

stuff like:

* Reddit posts that mention our brand + niche keywords (this post helps AI too)
* Twitter threads with full company name + positioning
* guest posts on forums and blogs that ChatGPT scans

we planted seeds across the internet so LLMs could connect the dots.

\#4 we answered questions before people even asked them

on our site and socials, we added things like:

* “What companies provide VAs for under $500 a month?”
* “How much do VAs cost in 2025?”
* “Who are the top remote hiring platforms?”

turns oout, when enough people see that kind of language, AI starts using it too.

\#5. we stopped chasing google, we started building trust with LLMs

our Marketing Manager says, Google SEO will be cooked in 5-10 years

its crazy to see chatgpt usage growth, in the past 1/2 years, there's some people who now use chatgpt for everything, like a personal advisor or assistant

to rank, we created:

* comparison tables
* real testimonials (worded like natural convos)
* super clear “who we’re for / who we’re not for” copy

LLMs *love* clarity.

tl,dr

We stopped writing for *Google.*

We started writing for *GPTs.*

Now when someone asks:

“Who’s the best VA company under $500/month full time?”

We come up 50% of the time.

We have asked our team members in Ukraine, Philippines, India, Nepal to try searching, with cookies disabled, VPN, and from new browsers, we come up,

Thank you for staying till the end.

Happy to make a part 2 including a LMO content calendar that we use at our company.

**The journey:** Started this after getting frustrated spending hours daily trying to stay informed across tech/business/AI news. Talked to my finance professor about how he goes about it (especially to understand how he keep track of news for trading and corporate related) and realized I wasn't alone - many professionals struggle with information overload, echo chambers, and turning news into actionable insights. 

**What I built:** AI-powered intelligence platform that synthesizes multiple news sources and provides different analytical perspectives.

**Solo founder challenges faced:**

* Scope creep (started with 20 features, launched with 5)
* Perfectionism paralysis (finally just shipped it)
* Tech decisions without a team to bounce ideas off
* Wearing all hats (dev, design, marketing, support)

**Current roadblock:** Waiting on payment gateway approval, so using this time to get user feedback.

**Lessons learned:**

* Ship earlier than comfortable
* User feedback &gt; my assumptions
* Simple MVP &gt; complex perfect product

Would really appreciate feedback from this community - you understand the solo journey!

How do you handle information overload in your work? Would love to hear your strategies too."
3,Questions about market fit and lead generation for starting my own consultancy in DS/ML space,consulting,Dapper-Kitchen-6225,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1lsrr35/questions_about_market_fit_and_lead_generation/,"**Tl;dr**: Thinking about going it alone as a consultant, and looking for some advice/reality checks. I’ve been a consultant before on the technical side, but top of funnel sales is new to me. (Also apologies if this isn't the best subreddit to post on, I'm new here. Feel free to redirect me if so).

**More context**: a group of friends (Data Scientists, ML Engineers and Software Engineers) would essentially like to find consulting projects to do on the side, and go full time if we get enough business. We work at 2^(nd) tier companies (non-FAANG tech or big non-tech companies) and we’re lead engineers or above with \~10 to 15 years of experience. I’ve been a technical architect at a consulting company, where I designed solutions and led implementation, so I'm comfortable with what happens after getting a lead and initial discussions. I realize I have a lot of questions, if you’re able to provide any insight on any one question individually even it would be greatly appreciated, as I'm trying to decide if this is a pipe dream or not.

* While we have established brands on our resume (i.e. companies we’ve worked at), we would be starting a new consultancy, so no brand and no success stories (not even a website at this point). This will obviously be a challenge, but is it insurmountable? For which customers would this not be a deal breaker?
* Does the following market fit make any sense: my thinking is that we’ll be very competitive on price compared to major consultancies, but our customers would still be getting top notch technical skills. Some people want the best (or at least the best brand) and will pay for it – we can’t compete for them. Some will be focused on getting really inexpensive services, and they’re going to be looking for outsourced developers. But I’m thinking there’s a middle ground, where we’re attractive because you can get excellent developers, same time zone and no culture/language barrier, but a lot less expensive than elite consultancies. Am I being delusional?
* For pricing, I was thinking of charging somewhere around $150-$200/hour. Does that more or less fit with the market segment I described above?
* How much of a deal-breaker would it be that we have day jobs? Obviously we won’t consider projects where there’s a conflict of interest, but I imagine a significant percent of potential customers are going to immediately say no to not being able to dedicate 100% of time to the work. My hope is that it’s context/project dependent, and we can still find work that we can do part time.
* I’m quite new to the lead generation aspect of this. I’m trying to figure out who to reach out to, and how, for data science/machine learning projects. If this is answered already elsewhere, feel free to redirect me. I’m trying to decide:
   * Which level should I reach out to? (director, VP, CTO, etc)
   * Which departments? (Marketing, analytics, engineering etc)
   * Which medium? (Someone recommended buying email lists from Zoominfo or sending InMails on LinkedIn)
   * Which kinds of companies would be most open to this? (I realize this is a tough one to answer, it depends. But any rules of thumb would help.)"

I work at a MM consulting firm and have been selected for the H1B this April. Given the travel heavy nature of the job (unless it's a remote project), I'm at client sites most of the year (typically in other cities) and rarely at the home office.

In this case, do I need to file a new LCA everytime I am on a new project? My immigration attorney says no - I do not need to file a new LCA for travel or for a new project - but curious if this has been the experience for others as well. Based on research, I thought you needed to file a new LCA if you are spending more than 30 workdays in a new MCA."

I have solely survived because I like learning and HATE being compromised in terms of knowledge; however, sometimes I do get moments of impostor syndrome where I feel I do not know enough to lead a team.

3,Struggling with Content Direction &amp; Strategy,marketing,SweetOceanSourSun,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1ltnzxc/struggling_with_content_direction_strategy/,"We’re a leadership and management training company delivering courses across a wide range of sectors — from hospitality and automotive to tech, construction, and manufacturing etc. We’ve had thousands of 5-star reviews and consistently outstanding results from our attendees.

Right now, we publish a lot of content — mainly blog articles and leadership tips. Some recent examples include:

* *Master the Art of Delegation to Strengthen Team Performance*
* *Boost Leadership Impact Through Emotional Intelligence Development*
* *Sharpen Leadership Decisions with Advanced Critical Thinking Skills*

These are produced by a content agency, and while the topics are relevant, im sure the agency uses AI to produce them, meaning they come across as very generic and not cut through. I feel like they are just adding to the noise of an already ai polluted content landscape.

 There's little engagement on the blogs or social posts, and i dont think they are adding any value.

**We have** ***two*** **audiences:**

1. **Decision-makers**: HR leads, learning and development managers, and company directors, etc 
2. **Course participants**: Team leaders, chefs, sales managers, operations managers, material control managers 

We deliver training across such a broad range of industries that I’m not sure what type of content would truly resonate with *both* groups. I feel a bit lost when it comes to creating content that cuts through

**Content channels**

* **Social Media**: Mostly blog reposts (link + short overview), plus training tips.
* **Frequency**: We currently post 5 times per week across alll  platforms — but engagement is low, and it feels like we’re putting out content for the sake of it.
* **Blog:** posted on our website and linkedin

**Im thinking we should** 

* **Post less**: Reduce to 2–3 quality posts per week.
* **More storytelling**: Capture real stories from training sessions, share group photos, tag attendees  — to humanise the content and encourage engagement from those involved.
* **Still include tips/blogs**: But only the strongest ones, and possibly rework them to feel more authentic and relevant
* Some **course advertising**
* **Blogs**.. im really not sure

  
Some of our trainers have large LinkedIn followings (e.g., 27k+). Should we be using their personal profiles more to share content? If so, what types of posts work best from a personal profile versus the company page? And are there ways I can help them strengthen their presence or integrate more naturally with our overall strategy?  


**If you have any suggestions on** 

* Suggestions on content and topics that would *actually* resonate with both decision-makers and course attendees for the blogs or a blog strat that would cut through
* Ideas for using our trainers’ personal LinkedIn profiles 
* Any examples of successful strategies you’ve seen from training companies or similar B2B service brands.

I’d really appreciate any thoughts, thank you for your time if you got this far!!"
3,Quick Q for Agency Owners &amp; Marketers – How Do You Handle Dev Work?,marketing,edge_lord_16,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1lt5gi2/quick_q_for_agency_owners_marketers_how_do_you/,"Hey agency owners, marketers, and creatives,

I’m curious how you handle dev work when a campaign needs something custom (landing pages, integrations, CMS changes, full web builds, etc.).

**Specifically:**

1. Do you have an in-house dev, go to freelancers, or partner with dev teams?
2. What’s been your biggest pain point when working with developers?
3. If you've found a dev partner that worked *really well*, what made them stand out?

3,How do you keep long-term Meta Ads campaigns organized without losing algorithm learning?,marketing,Easy_Blackberry506,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1lry43s/how_do_you_keep_longterm_meta_ads_campaigns/,"I'm facing a recurring problem managing campaigns in Meta Ads: keeping campaigns running continuously to take advantage of algorithm learning eventually turns everything into a mess.

Since Meta doesn't allow you to archive ads or ad sets, only pause them, the campaign gets cluttered with dozens of old creatives over time. This makes it hard to analyze, reuse, or even activate new assets because everything is mixed up.

Deleting ads or ad sets isn't ideal either, because you lose historical data. But keeping everything (even paused) in the same campaign, with no efficient filters, becomes a nightmare to manage.

I'm currently trying to mitigate this with:

* Standardized naming (e.g. AD\_ACTIVE, AD\_INACTIVE, etc.)
* Monthly clean-ups and renaming of old ad sets

Still, it's really hard to keep a clean and optimized structure in the long run.

How do you manage to keep your campaigns organized over time without losing algorithm learning?

All input is welcome, especially from those who’ve tested different methods to solve this without hurting performance."

Many of the forums are maps hybrids - majority probably 💩 but nevertheless it could help with our backlinks which is the missing piece in our SEO game.



One thing we value is the automatic publishing to all of these directories, having multiple businesses this could quickly become a bottleneck if done manually for all websites.

Apart from some of the more technical stuff you can do, you guys need to condition your pixel.

Everytime you get a low value sale or a lead, qualified or unqualified, your ad platform is going to view that as a win and try to target more of those same people. Your pixel only thinks in terms of quality if you tell it to do so, and you definitely should.

You should instead set a desired certain conversion amount or only alert your ad platform of a lead when a lead is qualified. This way they will begin to understand the kinds of people they should actually be targeting and if you're not doing some variation of this you're leaving massive amounts of money on the table.

Definitely worth asking whoever handles your marketing to do so, or doing it yourself."
3,Stay at Google or jump to Databricks?,sales,Paschoni,16,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1ls1k4u/stay_at_google_or_jump_to_databricks/,"Hi everyone,

Looking for some wisdom on a tough career timing and culture decision.

I'm currently an Digital Natives AE at Google Cloud (L4) and, importantly, I just started a new role within the company one month ago. I'm already performing well and on track for hitting accelerators this FY. My established career plan here is to work towards a promotion to L5 within the next ~2 years, at which point my OTE should become similar to what Databricks is offering me today. I genuinely value the Google culture, my team, and the work-life balance.

I've received a very strong offer from Databricks to become an Enterprise AE. Financially, it's a significant and immediate step up (OTE is ~50% higher). The offer would essentially let me ""skip"" the 2-year wait for the L5 pay bump. It also comes with the excitement and high-upside of a pre-IPO equity package.

My dilemma is about timing and culture, not just money.

My head knows the Databricks offer is a massive financial accelerator. My gut is hesitant because I just committed to a new role and team at Google, I love the culture here, and I have a clear (though slower) path to my financial goals.

My Question:

Have any of you faced a similar choice between accelerating your earnings immediately vs. sticking to a longer-term plan at a company you love? "

3,My $10k/month ecommerce - Full Debriefing,ecommerce,Brazilboxer,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1lucmua/my_10kmonth_ecommerce_full_debriefing/,"I wanted to share a behind-the-scenes look at an online business I’ve been running for the past few years. It’s a lean operation that sells 100% digital products — no physical inventory, no shipping, no suppliers in China.

It’s not flashy, but it’s profitable, scalable, and largely automated.

I run a platform that offers **digital tools and services aimed at creators, social media managers, and small brands** — think optimization tools that help boost visibility, performance, and perception online.

These are **entirely digital, automated products**, instantly delivered after purchase, and often used to:

* Improve early traction on new content
* Enhance campaign visibility
* Create initial momentum for new brands or influencers
* Test social strategies with measurable results

The services are fulfilled through API integrations with trusted providers, and customers can fully manage their experience through a dashboard.

# How I started

I began about 3 years ago by reselling access to these tools manually. I’d handle orders via messaging apps, use spreadsheets for tracking, and manage fulfillment by hand.

It was messy, but the demand was clearly there.  
So I gradually reinvested the profits and built my own **fully automated platform**, which now includes:

* API-connected digital fulfillment
* Auto-checkout
* Multi-language UI
* Real-time order tracking
* Tiered pricing for resellers
* Affiliate/referral system
* Live support with chat and Telegram bots

Today, the system operates mostly on autopilot, and I serve both end users and a network of white-label resellers who rely on my infrastructure.

# Traffic and acquisition

Most of my traffic comes from:

* **Google Ads** (search and branded)
* **Affiliate referrals**
* **Organic SEO** (people searching for very specific tools)
* **Word of mouth** from resellers and satisfied clients
* **Occasional placements in closed communities or Slack groups**

LTV is strong, so I don’t mind investing more aggressively to acquire a customer — especially one who may return every month.

# What I’ve learned

1. **Simple digital products can be powerful when bundled and automated.** You don’t need a huge catalog — you need the right ones, with repeat usage and clear value.
2. **Automation unlocks scale.** Once I moved from spreadsheets to APIs and dashboards, my time involvement dropped to \~1hr/day.
3. **“Unsexy” niches = real money.** Everyone’s chasing trendy product categories. Quiet, technical niches with loyal users are often overlooked.
4. **A lean team beats a large one.** I’ve been solo-ops for most of this project. Support is semi-automated. Everything else is backend.
5. **Recurring usage &gt; one-time sales.** I’d rather sell a R$30 tool ten times to the same user than fight for R$300 one-offs each week.

If you're building or scaling a store and struggling with logistics, shipping issues, or saturated markets — you might want to look at **digital products**.

You don’t need to launch the next Notion or Figma. Sometimes, small, well-targeted, functional tools with automation can give you:

* Higher margins
* Faster scale
* Global reach
* Peace of mind

I’m not selling a course or trying to promote anything here — just wanted to share what’s working for me.

If you're curious about the tech, operations, or want to bounce around ideas for building something similar, I’m happy to chat in the comments."

* Drag and drop site builder
* Blog
* Good review app (ideally Judge.me)
* Automated fulfillment (can send automated emails with order instructions to fulfillment center)
* Ability to restrict certain products for view by everyone but purchase by logged in members only

whole thing across all the big name streaming services? Is it even worth it if we don’t have some
massive budget of $100K/month to devote to it??"
3,Klarna ruled against me in 100+ disputes – including one where the customer claimed to return an item to a physical store (which I don’t even have).

I run a small online store (no physical location at all), and over the past few months I’ve been dealing with a massive issue with Klarna. I’ve now lost over 100 disputes – most of them in cases where:
	•	Customers claimed they didn’t receive their item, even though I provided valid tracking showing successful delivery.
	•	Customers claimed they returned an item but gave no proof – no tracking, no receipt, nothing. Klarna still ruled in their favor.
	•	And worst of all: In one case, the customer claimed to have returned the item in a physical store.
But I don’t have a physical store. My business is 100% online. Klarna accepted this claim without verifying anything and ruled against me anyway.

I submitted a full, detailed list to Klarna. They just responded saying all decisions are final and that I should use their “Merchant Protection Program” in the future (which doesn’t even apply to most of the cases in question).

💸 I’ve already lost over €35.000 in revenue and refund fees, and Klarna seems to completely ignore the facts or any actual evidence I provided. It honestly feels like the customers can say whatever they want, and Klarna will just side with them automatically.

⸻

Has anyone had similar experiences with Klarna?
Is there anything I can still do at this point (legally, publicly, or otherwise) to get these decisions reviewed or raise awareness? I feel completely powerless, and this situation is threatening my entire business.

take their NAD+ supplement for example.  it's the wrong kind.  it doesn't do crap because it's too large to get into the cells you need the percussors!  but it's sold as if it's the same stuff!!  it's the NAD+ version, and you need the NR or NMN versions.  NAD+ is just pricey pee!

their creatine is $13, but it's half the amount of what would otherwise cost double - so what's the point?  

I am quite sad frankly, but it's turning all into anger.  So, it was a huge waste of time, a large waste of money but more importantly for me, I got my hopes up again only to be utterly disappointed.  

My supplement dream is over :(

I am going to look at back braces, posture supports and the like.  no regulatory bullspit or fake ingredients with a real product I guess.

3,I'm a leadership in a chain of 10 beauty stores in Brazil. Trying to liquidate dead stock via marketplaces. Is this the right move?,ecommerce,Stollkeer,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1lpcykl/im_a_leadership_in_a_chain_of_10_beauty_stores_in/,"I work in this chain of 10 physical beauty/cosmetics stores in Brazil. We're strong in one Brazilian state but face harsh competition in another one.

Our main issue right now is **dead inventory sitting in our physical stores**. We’ve tried syncing our e-commerce with our stores, but our inventory management is so bad it just causes chaos, mismatched stock, overselling, errors, etc.

So here’s what I’m trying to do:

* Set up a **mini fulfillment center**  on the second floor of one of our stores.
* Transfer dead/slow-moving stock from our stores to this space.
* Manage it through a **new, separate ERP system,** totally independent from the messy store systems.
* List these products on **Shopee, Mercado Libre, and Shopify**, focusing on aggressive pricing.
* Push paid traffic and clear out stock that’s just sitting there.
* Find niches that will buy specific products that are not selling in the physical stores. My hope is that being exposed to the whole national market they will find clients, I recently understood it because many orders were coming for products we generally never sell

We’ve done a spreadsheet-based analysis on one of the brands we work with and found:

* Over **60% of our paid-for inventory hasn’t sold a single unit in the last 90 days**.
* We’re sitting on **thousands of dollars in dead stock**..

We’ve got:

* The stock (already paid for)
* A budget for paid traffic
* A small, trustworthy team to manage this fulfillment center
* A modern ERP ready to go, separated from our store mess

**My questions:**

* Has anyone gone through something similar? A brick-and-mortar operation that made it work in marketplaces?
* Can a **brand-new seller account** on Shopee or Mercado Libre get traction quickly with volume + low prices?
* This wouldn't solve the mess of our current stock, but would raise our budget, which is very necessary at the moment.

Any experience or insight is appreciated — especially if you’ve made the leap from offline retail to e-commerce. I’m trying to recover frozen capital, gain digital traction, and eventually move toward a proper omnichannel strategy."

One introduced me to his Minpaku (short-term rental) workflow:

\- Download city PDFs/Excels

\- Manually check zoning, school zones, license feasibility

As an engineer, I thought: *This should not be manual.*

I went deep and built:

* A **clean database + map of 13k+ licensed Minpaku properties (Tokyo, Sapporo, more coming)**
* A **unified database of the scattered municipal regulations**
* Now, I can layer those + see where Minpaku is possible, and where it’s blocked

The core value of our product lies in the seamless unification of several services into a single, cohesive experience-rather than in the individual services themselves.

We’re navigating a clear trade-off between quality, reliability, reputation, and cost. Smaller providers often offer more flexible pricing and fewer compliance hurdles, but typically at the cost of lower quality and greater operational risk.

3,How much would you pay for real feedback?,SaaS,dgunseli,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1lu0zk6/how_much_would_you_pay_for_real_feedback/,"Hi everyone.



It’s like warfare for startups here. After AI tools became common, people started building solutions in just a week. Every day, maybe hundreds of products are being launched (I even launched 3 products within 2 months). But most of them fail for different reasons. It might be a technical issue, a marketing problem, or even pricing. 

During the last 6 months, I’ve noticed an important problem: **builders or companies can’t get “real” feedback quickly**. There are lots of posts (I shared too) on Reddit or Twitter asking for feedback. I know many of them are actually for marketing purposes (I did it, and I know it). But I also know that we need **constructive feedback** to improve our products. Sometimes, simple feedback makes the difference between a successful and a failed product.

\-- 

Anyway, after a while, I started thinking about building a **“feedback marketplace”** to let users buy feedback from real users. Before starting, I wanted to ask for your feedback (which will be free for now). Here's what I’m planning to build:

* There will be products and reviewers in the system.
* Product owners will start a “feedback request” by defining what kind of feedback they want (free text or structured) and setting a total budget. It can be about whole product, a changeset or even pricing model
* After launching the request, people can apply to give feedback and set their own price.
* Product owners can see the applications and accept whoever they want. The bid amount will be deducted from their budget.
* The reviewer will then do the review and send the feedback.
* Product owners will either accept the feedback or start a manual dispute if they find it irrelevant.
* If they accept it, they can rate the feedback. That rating will build trust between users, and the payment will be secured for the reviewer.
* If they dispute it, someone from our team will check it. If the feedback is valid, we’ll charge the company a dispute fee(which will be reasonable). If it’s not valid, the user may be banned, their earnings may be removed, or they might be charged, depending on the situation (this will be covered in T&amp;Cs).
* Once the process is complete, the reviewer will get their money (with a small commission cut), and the company will receive their feedback.

**Other important points:**

* Companies will pay a flat fee (a reasonable one).
* There’ll be a public feedback pool, where approved feedbacks can get a share from the public feedback pool (the budget will be split among approved feedback contributors)
* There’ll be a **rating and tiering system**. Users with higher ratings will be able to make higher bids. There may even be “feedback influencers” who earn thousands a month just by giving feedback.
* Reviewers will also have an experience tag, showing which topics or industries they’re familiar with.

  
\--

I feel like this could be a **win-win-win**. Companies might get feedback that helps them build products worth millions. Individuals can earn extra money (or even do it as a side job). And I can make money from small commissions. 

I know this sounds contradictory, but I need some **free feedback** from you:

* Would you use this platform if you're building a product or shaping one?
* Do you think a “£10 feedback” could help you make thousands?
* Or would you prefer getting feedback from free platforms like Reddit or Twitter?
* Do you know of any product that already does this?

\-- 

This is not a marketing post (yes, I’ve done that before but not this time) and not created by AI (it just helped me to fix grammar mistakes, since I'm not native English speaker). I just want to understand whether this is a real pain point for builders or companies.

Thanks in advance!

3,🚀 Stop Building SaaS Ideas Nobody Wants,SaaS,RingCorrect8327,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1lu0alb/stop_building_saas_ideas_nobody_wants/,"After seeing too many founders (including myself) spend months building products that nobody wanted, I created **EarlyLaunch** - a platform to validate your SaaS idea before you build it.

## The Problem I Solved
We all know the stats - 75% of startups fail, often because they build something people don't actually need. Traditional landing pages are clunky, and most waitlist tools are just glorified email collectors.

## What EarlyLaunch Does
- **Branded waitlist forms** that actually look professional (no more generic templates)
- **Real-time analytics** to track signups, referrals, and engagement
- **Built-in referral system** to grow your audience organically
- **No-code setup** - launch in minutes, not days

## Why It's Different
Instead of just collecting emails, EarlyLaunch helps you actually *validate* demand. You can see engagement patterns, referral rates, and user behavior that tells you if your idea has legs.

## Early Results
10+ makers are already using it to validate their ideas before building. The feedback has been incredible.

**Special for r/SaaS**: 75% off lifetime pro deal for the first 20 makers who sign up.

3,4 Years of LinkedIn Automation: What Actually Works in 2025,SaaS,Cold_Presentation502,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1ltvl7q/4_years_of_linkedin_automation_what_actually/,"Hey everyone, just wanted to share a few lessons I’ve learned from automating my LinkedIn account and how I’m consistently getting results through connection requests and messaging.

I’ve been automating LinkedIn for 4 years now. I’ve tested just about everything, and one thing I’ve realized is that unlike cold email, LinkedIn doesn’t give you infinite ammo. There’s a weekly limit to how many invitations you can send, and once you hit it, even with a paid account, you’re done for the week. That means you have to be good. If you waste 200 invites on the wrong people, that’s it. You wait a week and start over. So LinkedIn forces quality over quantity.

It’s not super scalable, but it brings me clients consistently.

I’ve tried casting a wide net, doing mass outreach, adding notes to invites, you name it. Let me give you the blueprint of what’s actually working now.

I use two tools. First is gojiberryAI, which is our own product. It tracks high intent leads, so I’m only reaching out to people who are active and showing signs of interest.  
  
 Second is Walaxie, because I got a lifetime deal on AppSumo a while back, but there are plenty of other great tools out there.

Each month I pull a list of about 300 leads from GojiberryAI. These people have commented on relevant posts, joined events, interacted with competitors. Basically, they’re warm. That’s very different from a standard Sales Navigator search, where you might filter by title and end up with a list of people who haven’t been active in months and may not care at all about what you’re offering.

With regular lead lists, maybe 20 percent of the people are even remotely interested. And of those, only 10 percent will accept your connection. So you're left with conversations from just 2 percent of your total list.

By targeting high intent leads, your connection acceptance rate goes way up. You’re only talking to people who are alive and possibly interested.

I strongly recommend not adding a note to your connection request. I’ve tested it many times. Notes almost always underperform. Also, avoid long campaigns with tons of follow-ups. One follow-up is more than enough. Instead, get their email and run a cold email sequence in parallel.

In the past, I used to run LinkedIn campaigns with five or six follow-ups. Sure, sometimes it worked. But honestly, it damages your LinkedIn account and feels spammy. It's better to focus on prospects who reply early. Then, months later, you can retarget the rest with new messaging. That works much better.

For the first message, I keep it short and clear. Something like, ""We do X, it helps with Y. Would that be useful to you?"" Then a short reminder if they didn’t respond. After that, I stop and move them into nurturing sequences later on where I don’t try to sell anything, just share value. These go out a few weeks after the initial flows.

The key to everything is having the right leads. Then, you have to make life easy for the prospect.

Make sure your LinkedIn profile and banner clearly show what you do. Make it obvious how to book a call. Have a live website. Post content regularly. If people see you have engagement and activity, they’re more likely to trust and accept.

And here’s something surprising. Some people never accept my connection request, but they’ll book a call anyway. That means your profile alone can convert people.

Hope this was helpful. Feel free to drop questions in the comments. I’m currently scaling gojiberry from 0 to 1 million ARR and we should hit that by December.   
  
Hope you’ll follow along the journey."
3,How often do you start a project from literally zero?,webdev,Algor_Ethm,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1lue9o9/how_often_do_you_start_a_project_from_literally/,"Like, literally setting up connection to the database, authentication, sessions and develop the application functionalities out of nothing?

I've done a few technical projects (silly things) and now I want to pivot into real world experience with some pro bono work, like, talk to real (small) businesses and see if I can build something for the problems they might have and I want to know if I should make their solutions (whatever it might be) from the ground up or see what things are out there that can solve it or that I can use to shorten development times and deliver a better product faster?

For example, I want to help a friend with his project, he is trying to build some sort of tourism agency that promotes and organizes social events, mostly art related. Basically a platform to share events and make them know to people in my city.

And I've been thinking of building a CMS site for them, to publish their events, then automate social media publishing (instagram, wsp, facebook), forms for businesses and organizers to contact them, calendar and reminders integration for people who are interested in these events.

But I'm not sure if I should try to code everything or go and use Wordpress or Payload and some forms plugins or something like Tally.so.

But I'm not sure if I should build the CMS and the socialmedia automation from 0 (using scripts with the API) or use already stablished solutions and integrate them to avoid doing menial stuff that is critical but not as related, as creating an admin panel or setting up the session management."

Here's what I found",webdev,adviceguru25,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ltd95p/i_asked_8500_people_around_the_world_how/,"I'M BACK from my last post on this sub with 2.5K more users and some more models added (Mistral and Qwen!) 

**Disclaimer**: All the data collected and model generations are open-source and generation is free. I am making $0 off of the voting platform. Just sharing research that I've conducted and found.

Over the last few months, I[ have developed a crowd-source benchmark for UI/UX](https://www.designarena.ai/) where users can one-shot generate websites, games, 3D models, and data visualizations from different models and compare which ones are better (and we just added UI components recently).

I've amassed nearly 6K votes with a little over 8K users having used the platform. **Here's what I found**:

1. **The** [Claude](https://www.designarena.ai/models/claude-opus-4) and [DeepSeek](https://www.designarena.ai/models/deepseek-reasoner-r1) models **are STILL among the best for coding and design.** As you can see from the leaderboard, users preferred Claude Opus the most, with the top 8 being rounded out by the DeepSeek models and Grok as a surprising dark house. Since last time, a surprising new comer has been [Mistral](https://www.designarena.ai/models/mistral-medium-2505)**.** v0 has seemed to drop off (the model produces good website designs but struggles to follow instructions / system prompt). 
2. [Grok 3](https://www.designarena.ai/models/grok-3) **is an underrated model.** It doesn't get as much popularity online as Claude and GPT (most likely due to Elon Musk being a controversial figure), but it's not only in the top 5, but much FASTER than it's peers.
3. [Gemini 2.5-Pro](https://www.designarena.ai/models/gemini-2.5-pro) is hit or miss, though it has been rising in the rankings continually! I have gotten a lot of comments from users about why Gemini 2.5-Pro is so low. From a UI/UX perspective, Gemini sometimes is great, but many times it develops poorly designed apps, all though it can code business logic quite well.
4. [OpenAI's GPT](https://www.designarena.ai/models/gpt-o3) is middle of the pack and [Meta's Llama Models](https://www.designarena.ai/models/llama-4-maverick) **are severely behind it's other competitors** (no wonder they're trying to poach AI talent of hundred of millions and billions of dollars recently).

**Overall Takeaway**: Models still have a long way to go in terms of one-shot generation and even multi-shot generation. The models across the board still make a ton of mistakes on UI/UX, even with repeated prompting, and still needs an experienced human to properly use it. That said, if you want a coding assistant, use **Claude**."

I'm at the stage where I'm finally getting 4x100 on desktop, and *almost* 4x100 on mobile - for most of the time. I can live with 99/100 ""Performance"" score on mobile, but the issue is that PageSpeed Insights are returning really inconsistent results, even in a short timeframe. Sometimes even 79/100 or lower for ""Performance"" - with the exact same page source. I've tried everything: adding LogRocket to review what's going on during PSI test sessions, removed it later as I figured out that every `console.error` is visible in the PSI report, so implemented a full frontend logging and logged every single event as an error, just to review it line-by-line in PSI report. Still nothing. It's driving me crazy and after two weeks of hard work, I'm hoping to get some help here.

The issue is only with PageSpeed Insights. With Lighthouse, I'm finally getting 4x100 all the time - of course network throttled to ""Slow 4G"" and CPU throttled to ""Low-tier mobile"" based on the official calibration (15.4x for me).

I have most of the CSS inlined, http response compressed, above the fold hero image and fonts in preload hints, implemented a multi-layered JS preload: 1) almost nothing external loads before ""window.load"", after that 2) the consent &amp; tracking scripts, after that 3) UI related, most important stuff (swiper, countup, dependencies, etc.) and custom image lazy-load initialization, and after that 4) only on user interaction, some other, least important stuff improving UX.

I'm almost sure, that the issue is caused by the consent (CookieYes) and tracking (GA4) scripts, but I don't get, why. Reviewing the (error) logs in PSI, I see that I get a ""window.load"" event in 0.5s even in the worst case. And on ""window.load"" everything should be visible and nothing is expected to change in the viewport. There is no way to get a FCP:2.3s and LCP:4.2s when logs show that almost even every lazy-loading is finished by 1.0s. (log timings are based on `performance.now()`)

Here is the PSI result with 79/100 ""performance"" score on mobile:

And it will download and save the images automatically.

# Features:

* Uses the Unsplash API to search and download high-quality images
* Automatically saves them to a specified local folder
* Randomized images
* Works with MCP-compatible agents like RooCode or Cline
* Modular and easy to extend

# Requirements:

* You'll need a **free Unsplash API key**: [https://unsplash.com/developers](https://unsplash.com/developers)

I am ranking for around 250 keywords now, with 30+ in the top 20 and 10 in the top 10.

Still I got to 132 visitors this month, is what I can see in Google Analytics (and it only gives me information from Feb 17 onwards, so this is like 100+ visitors within 2 weeks?). I guess this is a good start, but I don't have any reference points.

For reference, my website is about learning Japanese online for free and I sell free guides to learning Japanese. My blog posts are 50% about the language and 50% about the culture. These two are also pretty intertwined, so I think this is a good approach (also because I like both just as much). I am not allowed to self promote of course, but if you want a better insight in my website, it's linked to my profile!

I think it's a good start to get to this amount of visitors, and I can image this growing with 100 visitors additional every month. The thing I am not too sure about is when and how should I think about making money with the site? I love giving these free guides to the community but maybe in a few years I think I also would want something back, is that cruel of me or do you think that's okay to do?

3,Why is this content marketing strategy so successful suddenly?,juststart,FutureEye2100,16,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/1alulcv/why_is_this_content_marketing_strategy_so/,"While exploring recent developments on technology websites, I stumbled upon a blog that seems to contradict Google's HCU guidelines. Yet, it is remarkably successful, which piques my curiosity. I'm intrigued by how this strategy has managed to succeed so significantly and for such an extended period.

The blog's domain is fritzboxes.de. Here some insights from my semrush analysis:  


* Launched approximately six months ago.
* Unhealthy backlink profile, with an excessive ratio of dofollow links compared to nofollow links. However, many image backlinks.
* Features content, including images, that are AI-generated (mostly depicting non-existent routers).
* Heavily uses Amazon affiliate widgets.
* Lacks author profiles and an ""About Us"" page.
* Demonstrates high integration in SERP features, especially ""People Also Ask.""

  
Interestingly, it outranks well-established websites like giga.de or vodafone.de, which have high topical authority. For example, searching for ""Fritzbox 7590 vs. 7590 AX"" (with a volume of 1300) shows this site ranking highly against top competitor.

  
So my question goes out to all SEO-Experts: What's the secret? Why is this approach succeeding while other blogs, striving to meet EEAT criteria in every aspect, struggle to make it to the top ten in SERP? Is this just some kind of honeymoon effect or the new HCU-adapted 2024 strategy of making money in AM?"

I’m integrating 8x8 for an American business that sends transactional SMS only (e.g., “Your project is complete,” job-workflow alerts). Absolutely no marketing blasts. We already use the Connect panel and can deliver SMS worldwide, just not to US numbers.

What I’ve done so far

* Opened ticket and supplied everything requested (company profile, HQ country, monthly volume &lt; 3 k, contact info, failed message ID etc.).
* Re-stated traffic is low-volume transactional; content + opt-out language provided.
* Confirmed we can send via API/Connect to non-US destinations without issue.
* Asked for a same-day call; was told they’re “at capacity” and to wait for sales.
* Keep getting the canned reply: “Choose 10DLC, Short Code, or Toll-Free; fill the onboarding form; our sales team will call.” No pricing table, no form link, no ETA.

Current roadblock

Account isn’t “fully onboarded,” no routing to US. Support won’t clarify the exact onboarding steps or send the required docs.

My questions to anyone who’s been through this:

1. What do I actually need to do (docs, forms, fees) to get 10DLC, Short Code, or Toll-Free enabled with 8x8?
2. What was the actual step-by-step you followed to get 10DLC or Toll-Free approved with 8x8?
3. Did you have to register your own brand + campaign in The Campaign Registry first, or does 8x8 handle that once you submit a form?

3,Advice on IAM for a realistic price,sysadmin,Rudelke,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1ltpzzd/advice_on_iam_for_a_realistic_price/,"Hi,

I am looking for an IAM solution that can be purchased and implemented by 3rd party company at a reasonable price point.

I need:  
\- Access management solution. In short I can check what a given user has access to. I need a place to confirm what a given user SHOULD have access to. Being able to add non-IT resources like cars or physical access would be a plus.  
\- Role based approval system. User request access to share XYZ. Request gets pushed to User's boss AND XYZ share owner for approval. After it's approved, access is granted either automatically or via email to admin.  
\- Scheduled access review. Once every X, all heads of departments and resource owners get a task to review access to their resource/off their employees.

  
What I looked into:  
OpenIAM  
In house solution  
Using Azure as IAM

Issues I found:  
OpenIAM - initial setup is fine. Learning it and creating resources is a steep mountain. I decided I need it implemented by 3rd party. Quote I got for my company (\~350 employees) hovers in hundreds of thousands Euros. This is not feasible.  
In house solutions - I have a team that could do it in house, but the time frame is way too long unless they drop everything else. While there is no deadline, we are preparing for NIS2 and so the deadline might come at any point.  
Azure - not enough for my needs.

Question for you Reddit - do you know of any solutions that would satisfy above need and won't cost a small country's GDP?"

Has anyone had to utilize AvePoint Fly to perform a OneDrive for Business to SharePoint migration before?

I may need to utilize this tool for an employee that is currently storing about \~200 GB in their OneDrive for Business account and had a few questions.

  
**Questions**

* **Intra Tenant Migrations for O365 (Same Tenant):** Does AvePoint Fly support O365 to O365 migrations within the same tenant \[(e.g., Tenant A (test.com) to Tenant B (test.com)\]?
* **Object Based Licensing:** How does Object based pricing work? From what I am seeing, AvePoint classifies OneDrive and SharePoint as separate objects and it sounds like I would need (1) Object based license for OneDrive and (1) license for SharePoint for a total of (2) Object based licenses for the monthly subscription.
* **Migration Limitations:** If (2) Object based licenses are purchased for the month of July 2025, does that mean that an unlimited amount of migrations can be performed between SharePoint and OneDrive during this active subscription window?
* **Folder Structure:** Would the tool be able to mirror the SharePoint folder (destination) structure to OneDrive for Business (source) or would the folder structure in SharePoint need to be manually created?
* **Folder Mapping:** Does AvePoint Fly support flexible folder mappings such as the below prior to performing the data transfers?

**Examples**  
**OneDrive for Business (Folder A + B) to SharePoint Site #1 (Folder B)**

**OneDrive for Business (Folder C + D + E) to SharePoint Site #2 (Folder C)**

* **Permissions:** Will the preexisting permissions for the migrated OneDrive folders (source) be retained in SharePoint (destination)?
* **Metadata:** Will the current Metadata for the migrated OneDrive folders be retained after the migrations such as file version history and other useful attributes?
* **Excel Links:** Can the tool preserve any Excel links to other Workbooks? For example if Workbook A has a VLOOKUP linked to Workbook B, is it possible for this to be retained or would it need to be manually edited?
* **Incremental Migrations:** Has anyone had to perform an Incremental migration using the AvePoint Fly tool? Just wondering what would happen to the files in SharePoint (Destination) if files are being edited in OneDrive (Source).
* **Support:** Has anyone had to deal with AvePoint Support before. Just wondering what your experiences were like, whether good or bad as I know they have phone and email support."

3,Cynomi purchasing experience: important thing to note for MSPs considering this product for vCISO or Compliance as a Service,msp,JohnSnyderNFI,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1lu2ks7/cynomi_purchasing_experience_important_thing_to/,"There are 2 ways to purchase Cynomi right now, and I made the mistake of purchasing Cynomi through both pathways only to find that this creates some problems. Hopefully other MSPs will read this before buying and avoid the confusion I stumbled into. TL;DR: you should only buy Cynomi either through direct purchase from Cynomi or through Pax8, but you cannot do both.

Option 1: Buy directly from a Cynomi sales rep. This requires signing an agreement that commits you to purchasing a minimum quantity for a 1-year minimum term, paid in monthly installments. The sales experience is pleasant, informative, and relatively straightforward. The biggest hurdle is that you have to commit to a minimum seat count of 6 (you can likely talk your sales guy down to a lower number), which is an $18k/year commit at $3k/seat. Bonus for buying direct are 3 additional included licenses: a NFR internal-use license, a demo license, and a free-to-use 30 day promotional license you can use to customize your pitch.

Option 2: Buy from Pax8's marketplace. This requires adding as many seats as you want to the cart and purchasing them directly from the portal. No need to interact with sales prior, and you get access to the platform right away and with minimal upfront hassle. You will receive an email from a Pax8 rep offering some assistance to get started, but it's more in the spirit of ""here's my contact info and calendar, grab some time so we can get you onboarded."" Nice part about Pax8 is that you can buy a single seat or two.

What we discovered was you cannot purchase from both Cynomi directly and Pax8. Apparently these are two entirely different instances. They do share some sort of similar front-end authentication platform, since both instances are aware of accounts that have been setup on one platform vs. the other (and they require unique credentials), but the licenses purchased directly from Cynomi or via Pax8 marketplace cannot be merged into a single instance.

Other software platforms we've been able to move our licenses over to Pax8 or off of Pax8 with just an email to the vendor or to our Pax8 rep. This is not at all the case with Cynomi. I sure hope they work this out at some point because the minimum purchase of 6 licenses from Cynomi is a massive barrier to entry, which Pax8 has clearly presented a solution for by allowing you to buy a single license at a time. However, it's a not a great look for any software provider like Cynomi to have a second point of rigidity where a license purchased through Pax8 cannot be added to or merged with an existing Cynomi engagement."

3,automation vs full-code : When does visual automation become a trap?,automation,Specific_Dimension51,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1lt2l0f/automation_vs_fullcode_when_does_visual/,"Hi everyone,

I've been using **n8n** quite a bit lately and love how easy it makes certain automations — triggering workflows, integrating APIs, transforming data visually, etc. But I’m starting to feel like there’s a limit to what you can (or should) do inside a visual automation tool.

Once workflows become more dynamic — looping through items, handling conditions, branching, managing variables, and orchestrating complex steps — it starts to feel... fragile.  
The more I build, the more I feel like I’m using a screwdriver to hammer nails.

So here are my main questions:

* **When do you feel it's better to stop using n8n and switch to a proper backend (like Node, Python, etc.)?**
* Have you hit scenarios where n8n became more of a burden than a help?
* What are some **clear signs** that it's time to move to ""real"" code?
* Any tips on a **hybrid approach** — where n8n handles the orchestration, and the logic-heavy parts live in microservices?

I'm not anti-n8n at all — it's powerful and great for prototyping — but I'd love to hear from others who’ve faced that transition point:  
Where's the line between **""no-code wins""** and **""just write the damn function""**?

Thanks!"

we were typing everything in by hand — vendor name, date, line items, totals — into Xero, one by one.  

it took hours and was costing over $45k a year in payroll just for invoice entry.

eventually we set up a process that pulled all the info out (no matter the format) and turned it into something import-ready. now it takes like 2-3 mins max per batch. a 10 pages invoice would take hours now it takes 1 minute. And it has 100% accuracy. Since is built for invoices data extraction only.

I'm trying to set up something that sounds simple but is driving me crazy. I want Claude to automatically send me a weekly email with business research - basically like having my own AI research assistant that works while I sleep.

What I want:

\- Claude researches business ideas, trends, pain points every week

\- Formats it into a comprehensive report (I have the exact format I want)

\- Emails it to me automatically every Monday morning

\- No manual intervention needed



What I've tried:

\- Zapier + Claude API (works but limited research depth, I found the response quality is very low compared to Claude Pro)

\- Various automation tools (none give me the research quality I need)



The problem: I can get Claude to do amazing research manually, but I can't figure out how to automate that same level of deep research + email delivery.



Questions:

1. Has anyone successfully automated Claude for recurring tasks like this?

2. What's the best approach - API, MCP, or something else?

3. How do you handle the scheduling part?

4. Any tools that can replicate Claude's research feature automatically?



I'm willing to get technical if needed, but simpler solutions are preferred.   
  
Any ideas or experiences would be super helpful!



Update: I'm specifically trying to replicate the kind of comprehensive research Claude does with its research feature - analyzing multiple sources, finding quotes, market sizing, etc. Not just basic prompts.

* I'm not sure how this will behave if you don't already have a reminders list called ""shopping list"".  Could someone test this out?  I tried to have it check to see if the list exists, and if it doesn't to create the list... but I couldn't get it to work.  Besides, I'm not even sure that's necessary.  It may just create this list automatically if it's not there. 
* it prompts for (voice) Dictated Text for each item you want to add to your shopping list.  I've attempted to set up a special action when the user doesn't respond anything (by voice) but I'm not sure how to make it work.  Currently if you don't say anything the script ends with a popup saying ""No title was provided.  Please provide a title for this reminder"".  I'd like to have it say a randomly chosen phrase like ""I'm sorry, can you say that again?"" and go back through the loop - or maybe I'll have it end the shortcut if there is no response.  Right now in my If statement, I have it set for Equals and the value is just double-quotes ("""") but that's obviously not working.  How can I define no verbal response?
* Right now, I have a (long) list of voice responses that you can say to end the script when you're done adding items (i.e.: ""Finished"" or ""All set"").  It only seems to work with the certain items in the list, but if I say many of the other ones (such as ""I'm done""), it will actually add that as an item to my shopping list.  I can't figure out why it's not working for everything in the list.

I very much appreciate any/all comments, suggestions, and technical assistance.  I am posting this in the r/workflow subreddit because folks seem so much more responsive here for technical questions (rather than r/shortcuts).  "

It's a personal computer, so by definition, you're dealing with a lot of different stuff; for me, it's primarily video games, D&amp;D stuff, personal photos, some music, a lot of stuff for Recording/Streaming videos, Resumes and work-samples, and some small amount of work stuff (nothing sensitive, mostly processes and templates I made I may want for future use).

On my PC, I tried to keep things simple, and just labeled things broadly as ""Play"" (gaming stuff), ""Record"" (for making videos), ""Stream"" (for streaming... which honestly involves a lot of the same stuff), ""Work"" (which includes resumes and cover letters), and then ""Other"", which has kind of become a catch-all for everything.

I feel like this has wound up not feeling super organized over time, though. Namely because ""Other"" has come to include like a million different things, from personal photos, to funny videos,  to NSFW stuff, to little writing projects... it's just *too* broad.

Someone ordered *seven pounds* of (let’s call them) Skittles. They emailed us to ask if we could remove **all the yellow ones** and replace them with **grape ones**. Seven. Pounds.  
\---

Let me break this down for anyone who doesn’t quite grasp what they’re asking.

You’re expecting someone to:

* Open up a huge pre-packaged mix (probably already bagged and sealed),
* Sift through **hundreds if not thousands** of tiny pieces,
* Pull out every single yellow one,
* Then open up a bunch of *other* bags,
* Pull just the grape ones,
* Replace them in your ""custom mix"",
* AND make sure the total weight still comes out to exactly seven pounds.

All for your personal order.

First off: who’s paying for the time it takes to do all that?  
Second: who’s going to compensate the next customer who ends up with a grape-depleted bag because we had to Frankenstein yours together?

Let me be clear:  
This is not a restaurant. You're not customizing your omelet. You're not special-ordering a wedding cake. You're buying a mass-produced item—like walking into Walmart and expecting the cashier to sort your candy colors at checkout.

Unless you’ve got a personal butler ready to make that dream come true, maybe just...do it yourself? Open the bag, sort it, and gift the yellow ones to a friend who doesn’t care.

Here’s my plea: **Before you hit “send” on your custom request, take 30 seconds and ask yourself—would** ***I*** **want to do what I’m asking this person to do?**  
If not, maybe reconsider.

That’s all. Rant over."
3,Managing 10+ WhatsApp numbers manually was chaos — here’s how we fixed it with HubSpot,CRM,sara733,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRM/comments/1lu3mnz/managing_10_whatsapp_numbers_manually_was_chaos/,"Hey folks,
We handle a high volume of WhatsApp messages — more than *10 different numbers* across sales and support. Back in the day, we used to manage everything manually, and yeah… it was messy.

We had to log chats manually into *HubSpot*, assign them to agents, follow up later (often too late), and things would get even worse during peak season. Some leads got lost, replies overlapped, and team coordination was all over the place.

At some point, we started looking for a proper solution to bring WhatsApp into our CRM without a bunch of workarounds.

Funny enough, we found a workaround using *Zapier* to automate some WhatsApp tasks and while it helped a bit, it still felt clunky and disconnected overall.

Then I noticed *TimelinesAI has a native HubSpot integration* in the marketplace. And honestly, that changed everything. Once we connected our numbers, messages started syncing directly to HubSpot. No Zapier needed anymore. 

If you’re using other CRMs (for most known CRMs they have native integration), however if you use some simple CRMs you can still use TimelinesAI with Zapier or Make for custom automations. They have different plans depending on what you need.

*What I Like About TimelinesAI*

▪️ Handles multiple WhatsApp numbers in a single inbox

▪️ HubSpot integration is super smooth — no manual copy-paste anymore

▪️ Agents can collaborate on chats without overlapping

▪️ Works with both Zapier and Make

▪️ Support replies fast and actually helps

▪️ It’s stable and just works once it’s set up


*What Could Be Better*

▪️ Doesn’t support e-commerce tools like Shopify

▪️ UI isn’t the prettiest, but it gets the job done

2. **Preset task buttons** – For repeat entries like follow-up logs or call updates, just click a button and it fills in your standard message or status.
3. **One-click smart log** – This fills multiple fields like text boxes, dropdowns, and checkboxes all at once based on a saved template. You can customize it to your workflow.

Now I’m hoping to hear from CRM users directly.

What tasks do you find repetitive or frustrating in your CRM?  
What would you love to automate or simplify?

I’m not selling anything. Just trying to build something helpful, and your input could directly shape how this extension evolves.

3,CRM with 2-Way Email (Gmail) and SMS + Automation,CRM,SellDense3658,4,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRM/comments/1lph4g8/crm_with_2way_email_gmail_and_sms_automation/,"I've tested quite a few CRMs but haven't yet found one that's both effective and affordable. I’m looking for a solution that offers:

* A unified inbox for two-way communication via **Google Workspace email** and **SMS**

HubSpot ticks all the boxes functionality-wise, but it becomes prohibitively expensive at scale—especially with the 50+ leads I receive daily, which quickly drives up contact volume and cost.

3,TIP for doing FREE mass email marketing with just HTML,CRM,TutorialDoctor,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRM/comments/1llppdb/tip_for_doing_free_mass_email_marketing_with_just/,"I needed a way to add a DIY email marketing locally from my personal computer. Here is what I did

1. Download the free [Thunderbird Email c](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/)lient and connect it to one of your email addresses.
2. Make it your default mail app (on Mac I did this from the Settings/General of the MacOS mail app).
3. Create a simple HTML page (you could use the VUE JS CDN to make it more dynamic and Tailwind CSS CDN to make it prettier) that loops over a list of emails and adds them to the `mailto` `bcc` attribute of an anchor tag. You can also create an image that you will copy over to your email. The anchor tag can be labeled ""Launch Campaign""
4. Now when you click the launch campaign anchor tag it will open Thunderbird with the list of emails BCC'd
```
&lt;a target=""_blank"" href=""mailto:email@example.com?subject=This is the subject&amp;bcc=email@example.com;email@example.com""
class=""shadow-blue-200/50 text-sm p-3 w-auto text-center text-white rounded-xl bg-[#3F8CFF] shadow-xl font-semibold""&gt;Launch Campaign
 &lt;/a&gt;

Notes:

* I had to manually drag over the image, but that's easy enough.
* HTML is simple enough to learn and CSS could make it prettier.
* You should create input boxes for your subject and load that into the subject value."

Trying to find a suitable CRM for our small business. If we can integrate with MYOB easily that would be ideal. Our primary focus is B2C, however we do some B2B.

Tall emu seems to do the trick however it's quite expensive and has a lot of features I don't really need. 

The main problems I need to solve are;

- leads coming in and not having a proper follow up procedure (ability to schedule follow ups)
- keep notes of customer interactions for future reference when they call (email records would be awesome)

Will be used by a small team, maybe 5 people max. We manufacture, quote and install for residential properties as our main income.

Can anyone recommend something that you use?

I am currently a student and finding it hard to find a full tine job and recently I have got an interview. I’m preparing for a technical interview where I’ll be asked to propose an integration strategy that connects:

* **Salesforce Sales Cloud** (public-cloud CRM)
* **An on-premise ERP** (SQL-based, can’t move to the cloud)
* **A yet-to-be-selected PDM/PLM** (likely Windchill, Teamcenter, or similar—also on-prem)

**Business goals**

1. Give Sales/Support near real-time visibility of orders &amp; invoices inside Salesforce (and let updates flow back to ERP).
2. Push BOM / ECO changes from PDM → ERP, and send production feedback ERP → PDM.
3. Keep the firewall tight—ideally no inbound ports opened—while meeting GDPR and IP-protection requirements.
4. Handle \~1 million API transactions per month and occasional large BOM bursts.

# What I’d like help with

**1. Possible technical solutions**  
  • Middleware choices (MuleSoft Runtime Fabric, Dell Boomi Local Atom, Apache Camel + Kafka, etc.)  
  • Patterns that worked best for near real-time Salesforce ⇆ on-prem ERP links  
  • Tips for buffering big BOM/ECO bursts without nightly batch jobs

**2. Interview prep**  
If you’ve sat on either side of the table for similar roles, what **technical or scenario-based questions** did you ask/answer?  
Examples I’m anticipating:

* “Describe an architecture that avoids inbound firewall holes yet still lets Salesforce receive ERP data in real time.”
* “How would you guarantee order-to-cash data consistency if the ESB goes down?”
* “What KPIs would you monitor to prove integration health?”
* “How do you handle versioning when PDM revisions update a live BOM in ERP?”

  
I really appreciate your help in this. Thank you again."

* Do freelancers and/or small businesses actually use a CRM? 
   * If yes, what features do you value the most?
   * If no, why?
* In terms of relationships building, would you value features and analytics that give you feedback about what is working and what needs more attention?

3,Making CRM Decision between Salesforce and Hubspot,CRM,No-Combination6956,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRM/comments/1lgdt12/making_crm_decision_between_salesforce_and_hubspot/,"Hello all, I'm new to Reddit (my first post).  I'm looking for some advice on CRM.  I joined a start-up that was still in stealth mode over 3 years ago.  I implemented Salesforce CRM (it is a super basic implementation - not a lot of customization at all , outside some custom objects and integrations of some managed packages (LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Outreach, etc - really basic stuff.  We are now out of stealth mode, in Growth mode and starting to scale.  We currently have 30 users on Salesforce, but out of the 30 - only half use it on daily basis.  Background on my company - B2B Enterprise Software selling to very large, global organizations and government agencies.  Our Marketing Automation tool is Hubspot, which was implemented shortly before I joined the company.  A couple of years ago, we set up the standard Hubspot-Salesforce integration, which has been nightmare for me to manage.  Now I am tasked with evaluating if we should move to Hubspot CRM.  I'm currently a Sales Operations team of one, so managing the CRM is a ""side gig"" for me and I am not a certified administrator and often rely on contractors for things that are outside my skill sets.  My prior experience is with Salesforce (as is most of our sales team), but I am not opposed to moving to Hubspot.  But if we are going to make a move, then now is the time.  Honestly for our business right now, Hubspot would be more than sufficient, but I'm worried as we scale, that the CRM won't be able to keep up with demands.  Our team will be scaling from \~30 people today to over 150 in the next 5 years.  While we are global today, we are really only focused in Americas and Europe.  That will also scale over the coming years.  We are not a digital sales company.  While our sellers leverage Zoom for some calls, they also get out in the field to visit customers on site.  I also see us adding more and more custom and 3rd party applications over time.  For example, I am now at the point where we are about about to implement pricing into our CRM.  We offer Software (both term and perpetual licensing), Hardware (not a lot of SKUs), and SaaS in the Cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure, etc).  I mention this because while we don't have a ton of SKUs, with the Maintenance &amp; Support, add-ons and Professional Services, our Pricing can get a little complicated.  (We currently do this in Excel today), but I want to move into the CRM this year.  We also recently implemented MEDDIC and incorporated a simple, effective and cost-efficient 3rd party solution in Salesforce that I was able to implement on my own with very little documentation - and it has been zero maintenance.  (I love it) But this 3rd party program is currently unavailable in Hubspot.  I will be starting to hire next year, but the current business model is to be lean, so I'll never have access to a big team of folks to manage our CRM.  I've spoken to some peers in the industry, some contractors that implement and support both Salesforce and Hubspot platforms and most are telling me to stay away from Hubspot as it won't scale with us based on our plans.  With that said, very few have been able to articulate why.  What kind of scaling issues will I run into if we choose to go to Hubspot?  Is anyone out there running a Hubspot CRM implementation with sales teams of over 100 people and if so, are you happy with it or regret staying on the platform.  So far, I haven't been able to find able to find any Hubspot CRM references with over 100 person sales teams that are not organizations that are digital sales organizations.  (I suppose this should be a red flag, but maybe my network is not broad enough).  Sorry for lengthy post, but wanted to provide some background information. I know Salesforce can meet our needs as we scale the organization- it will get pricey, but the platform supports some of the largest organizations in the world and is super customizable.  Plus there are so many skilled Salesforce Administrators out there that I can hire.  How big is the community of certified Hubspot admins?  Looking for any thoughts on this subject.  Please no solicitations."

Most of our leads used to come from referrals or some inbound stuff, but it’s been slower this year, so we gave cold outreach another shot.

I tried doing it last year and got nothing, so I wasn’t expecting much.

This time I kept it really simple:

* Got bulk leads using **Warpleads** (mostly sales directors at companies using Salesforce)
* Used **Apollo** to find some more niche roles we needed
* Wrote short emails focused on one specific pain point

We sent around 1,300 emails, ended up with 38 replies, 12 calls, and 2 deals closed.

Not huge, but honestly just glad it didn’t flop again like before.

The work I did for the job was pretty much repetitive, but I am grateful for the instances when I helped resolve cases and that's where I contributed a lot. Unfortunately, I only have working knowledge when it comes to banks and I don't have much depth in terms of finances and accounting. 

Currently I am studying for Enrolled Agent Certificate. I've thought about the studying for a bachelor's degree for accounting but decided not to because I kept stalling from the neverending research if investing my time and money will be worth it. I'm not saying EA is easier but I figured it'll be the most optimized way to dip my toe.

I do plan to volunteer in the VITAS program to gain more experience.

I submitted a request form for any/all documents related to the case and was denied, citing NRS 432B.280 and 432B.290. I have been advised by a local attorney that my being the subject of the report entitles me to a copy of it, and they recommended calling the office tomorrow to ask for clarification.

Basically my neighbor is constantly harrassing us. I won't go into a whole backstory over the last 5 years, but I'll try to sum it up in points.

\- I have called the police 3 times on him in the last 12 months, two of those times in the last 2 weeks.  
\- Neighbor yells over every now and then, which isn't that bad, but he's done some pretty bad stuff that unfortunately I have no proof of.  
\- First call to police was him shooting BBs down the street while we were on our porch that ricochet into my yard. Metal BBs. Almost hit my wife and I. No proof, but police were called and talked to him.  
\- Second call was 2 weeks ago. I was outside with my 10 year old daughter in my yard letting off a few fireworks. He came screaming and saying to shoot them somewhere else and started yelling at my daughter and I about how we're shooting them off over his house. We 100% were not. Police came out and he was trespassed from our property. He didn't actually go on it, but the police suggested it so if he does he will be arrested. Neighbor also made comments to me (I'm originally British) as he walks away saying that I need to call ICE while I'm at it. This is the 2nd time he's said stuff like this. A year ago he said screaming in public about how I ""need to get your immigration papers in order"".. I am a Lawful Permanent Resident so there are no papers to get in order.

\- Third time was yesterday when I was letting off fireworks again with my daughter. He was standing at the edge of his property with his phone recording us for 20 minutes just standing there. After I while I said ""what's your problem"" and he said ""YOU"" and started accusing me of letting off fireworks over his house again. I did not. I confronted him and he got 1-2 inches into my face. I have phone video that I got of this when I confronted him. I also told him to leave my family alone, and he said ""No! I'm not gonna leave you alone."" and then started getting all upset because I have cameras on my property that happened to catch his property in view.

Police actually suggested we get cameras and do this, and said it's reasonable because we're capturing our gates and any confrontation with him at the same time. His property is 180 ft away so my cameras can't even pick up hardly anything that far away. It's not like I'm pointing them directly at his house, it covers 70% of our property and some of his happens to be in it. Third time police came out they were not happy with him, and one officer even let off some of our fireworks in front of him to prove that we're not doing anything wrong. Super cool and chill.

\- Basically he constantly comes out his yard, records us with his phone, makes my daughter feel super uncomfortable as he records her in her own yard. I have many videos of him doing strange things that seem stalkerish/harrassing like leaning behind his garage with his phone as he records us. Coming out of his house running with his phone and recording Amazon and UPS delivery drivers delivering packages to our house.

It's on record that he's pointed laser pointers at my chest while I've been snow blowing, but no proof since that was when his behavior started escalating. I have about 8-10 videos, 3 police reports of him constantly yelling stuff over, recording my child, me, my wife, us leaving our house. It seems malicious in nature. I can't mow the lawn without him coming out and recording me.

It goes on and on and on, he's been told multiple times on multiple videos to STOP and leave us alone and he continues, and this latest one where I confronted him where he says he's not gonna stop feels like an escalation and threat to me. My daughter doesn't like playing outside because when she leaves our backyard the ""creep"" comes out to watch and sometimes record her.

I know nothing criminal is being broken here technically, but what are our chances of getting a protection order to stop him communicating with us?

Police said to keep calling them and building evidence and that's what we've been doing, but our 4th July was turned into a rollercoaster of constantly calling the cops, letting off about 1/4th of the fireworks we had because of him making us feel fearful that if we let any more off he's going to start stuff, and he keeps doing weird stuff like telling me to come on his yard so he can show me and I'll find out what he can do, putting his hand behind his back and all sorts when he says that. Didn't get it on video but he does that stuff. I know, he said, she said, but yeah. My daughter is scared of him and feels scared in her own back yard because of the ""sniper"" incident where he screamed over he's sighting in his rifle on me from a few years ago. \*sigh\*.

Sorry for the long post. Should I wait, and get more evidence, or do I have a decent case? Also what type of attorney am I looking for? Family law? I don't know. Any advice would be helpful."

4 months ago I was hit by a car biking home from work, resulting in a (seriously) broken wrist.

(I was not at-fault and in the bike lane when this happened.)

I hired an attorney for my settlement. Unfortunately the at-fault driver had the state minimum, $20k, so my attorney was able to get me a check cut quickly.

Before my settlement check was cut, he told me I'd be entitled to Personal Injury Protection (PIP) from the at-fault driver's insurance company.

I was told this would cover lost wages and medical bills.

But since my attorney took his 1/3 of my settlement check, I haven't heard much from him since, leaving me with no help to be reimbursed for :

$4000 in lost wages

Another $1000 in medical bills (and counting)

I'm going to pursue this PIP claim myself since I'm not getting any help.

Anything I can say or do to come across as competent and make sure I get what I'm owed?

  
EDIT : I have the PIP claims adjuster's information. She told me she needs wage verification from my employer for 12 pay periods prior to my injury. My payroll department is being less than helpful about this as well, generating reports rather than getting me paystubs. I'm getting these myself. Can I submit them to the insurance company or will they want to see this from my employer directly?"

Backstory: I worked at a customs car shop as a vinyl installer for 8 months. When i got hired i was the only installer and there was 2 other guys who got hired at the same time as me, their dutties were prep vehicles for the vinyl. I had just completed a 5 day training course to learn how to apply vinyl to different surfaces. The 2 guys had 0 experience inthe auto industry. 
The owner of the shop did not provide training and was rarely at the shop, leaving us 3 new employees to figure things out. 
We got the hang of running the shop, communicating with the customers and doing the job. The only thing we didnt do was take payments (the owner asked for it to be zelled or cash apped to him).

For the first few weeks we were all getting paid on time, he would give us cash or cash app. A few weeks go by and he starts delaying our pay by a day or two, saying he was waiting on payments from his customers to come thru. This happened many times but we were still getting paid. However, later on he was only paying us a portion of what we were supposed to get, he would tell us he would get us the rest the next day or a couple days later. He created ""tabs"" of what he was behind on as far as our pay, and it quickly grew into the thousands. He got so behind on pay and eventually stopped paying us. 
For the time i was there he went thru about 15 employees that all left xue to him not paying them. Only 1 guy that started with me was still working there.
The owner owes money to everybody, from customers, employees, family members, friends,  to his shop warehouse landlord.  He didnt pay his rent for a while, this caused us getring locked out a few times and it is currently locked to this day due to non payment.
I left during this time because 1. I wasn't getting paid and 2. We kept getting locked out.

Now onto the issue that i am looking to get advice for: I filed a wage claim for the   unpaid wages through the Texas Workfoce Commission. I have a offer letter that i had signed when i got hired, it specifies how much i get paid per hour and the comission that i got per vehicle completed, as well as the details of my dutties and the expectations from both parties (employee and employer). It mentions that i will be paid after 2 days of completion of the job as long as there is no chargeback on the customers end, which he failed to do for many months. Also the ""tab"" that he had for me was wrong because i forgot the specifics of the ""contract"" (offer letter) that we had, and he was updating it with the wrong amounts (it should be more than what he has me down for). 
So i put all this info down on my claim and the TWC sent me a letter with the owners response. His respose mentions that i left my position without providing a 2 weeks notice, abandoned my responsibilities in ""several critical areas"" and i disrupted the workflow and created operational challenges for his company.  He claimed i left multiple jobs unfinished,  as well as damaged company materials and customers vehicles. He said that the damage was not only a setback in terms of repais but has affected his ""customer satisfaction levels and reputation of availability service"", and that my hourly pay was ancient on till and proper (not sure what that means), and that my bonus ""was not earned due to failure to complete tasks and the disruptions which impacted both individual preformance and meeting company targets"".

Ok so to start, the owner stopped paying me MONTHS before i left the job, so his response is automatically invalid because he claims that me leaving caused his all his problems. Also its not a ""bonus"" , its a comission per vehicle completed, i have a list of the vehicles i did and tooks pictures and also recorded myself working on the vehicles. And damaging company materials, i brought in my own materials to work with, and nobody has come back due to ""damage"" to their vehicles. There is no damage that i or anybody is aware of. 
His ""setbacks"" were his own fault for never ordering materials to work with or his other employees quitting because he didnt pay them either. 
There are so many details that can help me with my case, i just want an outside opinion on what i can respond to all these lies, because this guy is really good at BSing his way out of trouble, he just isn't smart enough to hide his paper trail. "

2,Software for online teacher and student to keep track of lessons owed?,freelance,flying-benedictus,9,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1lt9fvq/software_for_online_teacher_and_student_to_keep/,"
I work as an online freelance teacher. In most cases, students buy a package of lessons and then we book the lessons, either at the end of a lesson or using calendly. I currently keep track of the number of lessons I owe them by adding a counter in the events in google calendar. In the cases where they owe me, the counter is negative.

But the students don't have access to this counter. And sometimes there may be subtle misunderstandings about the counter. For instance, a student cancels in the last moment and they aren't aware that I have a 72h cancelling policy (because they haven't read my terms of service) so they think the lesson isn't spent. Or somtimes it's a parent paying, teenagers forget lessons... I can send emails informing of the state of the counter but would look a bit weird.

I'd like to have some kind of portal where I log this, and students can see their lesson saldo, how it's recharged by certain invoices, how it's spent by certain agreed dates, etc. Is there an easy out of the box solution for this that I could install in a lightweight server or using the cloud?

Otherwise I could use a shared google calc sheet for each student, but it feels a bit more hackey solution.

I tried a few note apps, messaging myself links, using cloud notes — but nothing feels as fast and “invisible” as Apple’s Universal Clipboard.

Looking for outside perspectives (especially from other consultants) on how I’m approaching building a boutique quant risk &amp; data science consultancy.

My background is in Computer Science and I worked in finance as a “Risk Quant” / Data Scientist, building software and custom models. For the last year I’ve been solo, mostly building AI agent workflows, but I want to move away from “time for money” gigs and really leverage my specific skillset.

My goal is to build a **boutique consultancy** specializing in advanced risk modeling for lenders (regional banks, family offices, private credit) - not trying to do mass-market SaaS or race to the bottom on pricing. I’ve closed smaller consulting deals before and have experience with managing teams, marketing, and lead gen. But for something *considerably* higher-ticket, I’m wondering if my strategy is right:

1️⃣ Professional Website / LinkedIn (done)  
2️⃣ Case Studies: Building local market risk reports with my proprietary models, tailored to specific audiences  
3️⃣ In-Person Networking: I’m in an area with a high concentration of my ICP, so hoping to build real relationships

If anyone has experience in this type of B2B consulting sales, I’d love your thoughts. Specifically: **are case studies a good way to build trust (especially in finance)?** The idea is to leverage that trust into smaller paid projects, then retainers, and eventually larger custom build-outs."

They also mentioned the possibility of moving into a supervisory role down the line and put together a new package effective immediately.

I genuinely like my current company—the benefits are comparable to the new offer, and I have a lot of flexibility in my role since I’m considered senior. Work life balance is the best ive had in any job. That said, things have felt a little uncertain over the past few months after they let my manager go (I’m now reporting to a new manager). As the only salesperson here, I play a key role managing all accounts, and the new manager has been great so far, implementing positive changes like a 401k match. I shared my concerns with my manager about the counteroffer feeling like a temporary solution, and he assured me that I’m a key part of the department. Since he’s only been here a few months (while I’m coming up on my one year), he genuinely relies on and trusts my work, and I can see why he’s eager for me to stay.

Once the niche is given, research is done everyday via Tavily. The research is passed off to your LLM of choice which writes the script in whatever sort of voice / tone you want, and then that script is given to HeyGen, which generates a video of your AI avatar reading the script. From there it is posted on whatever socials you want via Blotato.

Setting up your avatar on HeyGen is surprisingly painless. Their pricing structure can be a little tricky though-- while you can get 10 video credits (10 minutes worth of video) on their free API plan, the next tier up will run you $99 / m. Sort of annoying that there is no mid tier between those two points but it is what it is.

Tavily gives you hundreds of searches for free every month so no cost there. LLM API costs will also be negligible. Posting to socials is done via Blotato here, which runs $29 / m. Alternative options include upload-post at a slightly lower price point.

More than anything, this workflow is a blueprint for you to leverage HeyGen AI avatars in the social media space. While this automation uses trending topics in your niche as a use case, that can really be swapped out for anything you deem relevant.

As the AI clone / avatar tech gets better and better, you're going to be seeing a lot of this-- for better or worse."

I inherited a massive excel sheet abomination and would like to move it to something more suitable. What i am looking at is a large pharma project with around 70% QC related tasks. Currently everything is managed in excel for multiple sites, from timelines, deadlines, personal workload, etc and i was provided with a simple JIRA lisence to handle this. I moved one part there related to the development board which was a hit, but the rest is a pain to deal with, with no color coding for tasks, no subtasks being visible in the timelines on a kanban board, no workload management tools, basically nothing except the basic license for JIRA. I have the go ahead to upgrade the a more costly license but am withholding on that until i can figure out if JIRA is even the right tool for the job here.


A big part of why a switch is desireable is because of constantly shifting deadlines that affect tasks that are linked down the line.

I would like to try to unify our sales dept into one single CRM. I’ve looked at Close, Bitrix, and some other stuff. 

My largest concern is the phones. Calltools is a premium call center solution with super high quality phone numbers. I love it. However, it’s a nightmare integrating with GHL. Simply executing a live transfer fails like half the time. Our reps get by, but I’d like to just get it all under one roof. 


Everything feels duct taped together. Here’s our stack:

Sales CRM, automations: GoHighLevel (total cost around $7k /month due to phone usage). 

Phones for sales closers/general sales: GHL phone system. 

Call Center/Appt setters: CallTools Enterprise (~$5k /month)

Client service/Legal dept: Zoho One, Zoho Voice. 

… is there any system out there that we could get into for under $12k /month all-in (including phones)?

I was thinking maybe it’s time to hire a developer to build out SuiteCRM. Idk.. it’s just a big undertaking and if someone messes it up it would cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost sales. 

Does anyone have any guidance? Anyone been in a similar predicament? 

Again, biggest concern is having phone lines with Level A carrier attestation, no spam flags, etc.

2,Protect yourselves from Credit Agencies selling your information. www.optoutprescreen.com,RealEstate,The_Void_calls_me,44,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1hao3ij/protect_yourselves_from_credit_agencies_selling/,"One of the most common questions posted here is:

**Why did I get a hundred phone calls from lenders after I got pre-approved?** 

Answer:

**Because the credit agencies sold your information.** 

How do credit agencies like Experian, Equifax and Transunion make money? 

Well one route is through something referred to as ""trigger leads"". When a lender pulls your credit, they are sending a request to the credit agencies for your credit report and score. 

When the credit agency receives this request, they know you are in the market for a loan. So they sell that ""lead"" to hundreds of other lenders looking to vulture your business. The credit agencies know everything about you. Your name, your SSN, your current debts, your phone number, your email, your current and past addresses etc. And they sell all this information. 

Well wait you might say. ""Don't I want to get a quote from hundreds of lenders to find the lowest possible rate?""

Sure. If that's why they were calling you. But a large portion of these callers are not going to offer you lower rates, they're simply trying to trick you into moving your loan, especially because buying all those leads costs money. Quite a few will lie and say they work for your current lender. Some overtly, some by omitting that they are a different lender. ""Hi! I'm just reaching out to collect the loan documents for your application!""

On the positive, they'll usually stop calling within a few days, but that's still a few days and a few hundred calls more than anyone wants to receive.

Currently the only way to stop your information from being sold is to go to the official website www.optoutprescreen.com and removing yourself."

It's day 20 since launching JustGotFound, and I wanted to share some numbers and thoughts.
So here's where we stand: 4,973 unique visitors, 365,343 page visits (49.78 hits/visit), 89 products launched, 90$ earned, and 28 clicks from SEO.
The SEO clicks might seem small, but for a 20-day-old domain, getting any organic traffic feels like a win. Google is starting to notice us, slowly but surely.
What's interesting is the consistency. We're averaging around 248 unique visitors daily now. Not massive numbers, but steady. And that's the thing about building something real - it's not about the explosive viral moments. It's about showing up every single day.
I've been spending most of my time now on user experience. When you have almost 5,000 people checking out your site, every small friction point becomes obvious. Navigation tweaks, loading speeds, making sure the value is clear within seconds of landing.
The 89 products launched tells a story too. Founders are trusting the platform enough to put their work out there. That's not something you take lightly. Each submission represents someone's nights and weekends, their hopes for what they're building.
Next focus: getting to 100 products. There's something psychological about that number. It feels like a real milestone, not just for me but for the community we're building.
One thing I've realized - consistency beats intensity every time. Those daily habit posts I've been writing? They're not just advice. They're reminders to myself. Show up. Plant the seed. Water it daily.
The market is noisy, but most people quit when the initial excitement fades. That's the opportunity. Keep building when others stop. Keep shipping when motivation dies.
If you're working on something, or have a product ready to launch, check out www.justgotfound.com. It's free to submit, and you'll get real users testing your work. We're building this together.
Thanks to everyone who's supported this journey. Your feedback, suggestions, and trust mean everything.

And which one has brought you better results (both financially and client-wise)?

I’ve noticed that when agencies price every little thing separately from a blog post, ad management, social post, website updates, etc. it gets overwhelming for the client and the team. Feels like you’re selling small tasks, not outcomes.

At the same time, I offer a mix of services (strategy, content, ads, email, etc.), so packaging it all together makes more sense to me. But then comes the tricky part... how do you justify the price of a fixed package when it’s covering multiple services behind the scenes, and also keep it flexible, for eg we want to work on an ad campaign for one month, then the next month we work on SEO content etc.

Then when it comes to hourly pricing, it can get messy and feel like you are constantly chasing hours and not outcomes. For example, if a client books 5 hours/month for paid media and I do a major overhaul in Week 1, sometimes the best thing to do is nothing for the next few weeks while the data settles and optimizes. But then you’re left either under-delivering on hours or scrambling to “fill the time” even though the work is already doing its job and getting results..

First off, my first time posting on this community. After thinking and overthinking, and saying maybe this week's not the right time, I finally feel confident to show off on a Saturday!

I wanted to build a good social login system, where clicking on “Sign in with…” buttons will NOT quietly hand over email addresses, capture behavioural data, and more.

I wanted something easy but extremely secure and private, so I built **Qrogin**: a privacy-first social login system with QR-and-passkey support/combination that gives control to users and is easy to implement for developers.

Qrogin is now in **beta**, and here’s what it offers:

    •Two-layer passkey login, verified by email and scoped to the specific domain
    
    •Cross-device login/ same device login using a one-time QR code or secure link(button)
    
    •No passwords, no trackers, and no hidden analytics
    
    •Masked or hashed email addresses by default
    
    •Minimal data retention, designed for full GDPR compliance
    
    •Accessible by design, to support users with dyslexia, autism, or cognitive fatigue

Link: [https://qrogin.com](https://qrogin.com)

It works through a clean JavaScript SDK or API. No third-party dependencies, no surprise popups, no dark UX tricks.

The WordPress plugin is on the way, but you can already use Qrogin right now in any npm-based project or custom frontend (npm package for the widgets-https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrogin. We also have a referral programme for developers who are building with ethics in mind.

Last year we tried to bring an LLM “agent” into a real enterprise workflow. It looked easy in the demo videos. In production it was… chaos.

* Tiny wording tweaks = totally different behaviour
* Impossible to unit-test; every run was a new adventure
* One mega-prompt meant one engineer could break the whole thing • SOC-2 reviewers hated the “no traceability” story

We wanted the predictability of a backend service and the flexibility of an LLM. So we built NOMOS: a step-based state-machine engine that wraps any LLM (OpenAI, Claude, local). Each state is explicit, testable, and independently ownable—think Git-friendly diff-able YAML.

Open-source core (MIT), today.

* GitHub: [https://github.com/dowhile/nomos](https://github.com/dowhile/nomos)
* Documentation: [https://nomos.dowhile.dev](https://nomos.dowhile.dev)

Looking ahead: we’re also prototyping Kosmos, a “Vercel for AI agents” that can deploy NOMOS or other frameworks behind a single control plane. If that sounds useful, Join the waitlist for free paid membership for limited amount of people.

Looking at previous posts, there seems to be a lot of love for Abnormal. In my current POC of both Abnormal and Check Point, we're so far enjoying Check Point more. Their team is more responsive and really knows their product. We're not seeing any difference in detection rates between tools. Our backend is Microsoft 365. We're a CrowdStrike shop, so going into this, I was leaning towards Abnormal due to their integration, but I'm wondering how useful that really is. Two concerns I have with Abnormal are 1. Future API rate limiting by Microsoft and 2. The fact users receive the email, and then it is removed. I've have a couple occurrences during the POC where the alert is still on my iPhone, but no longer in my mailbox. I'm concerned that would open more tickets with our support staff. I'm wondering what others have found in their recent experience with both products?"

1,Automatic Lead Magnets for ANY Agency,automation,lehamil,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1lsa1h0/automatic_lead_magnets_for_any_agency/,"I built a tool that feels a bit like cheating. It's a workflow that **automatically creates a personalized proposal** (or lead magnet) for LinkedIn leads (**as soon as they fill out a form)** and sends it directly to their email.

It asks for just 5 inputs:

* Full name
* Job title
* Their biggest pain point
* The software/tools they currently use in their biz
* Email

From there, it:

1. **Finds and scrapes their LinkedIn profile** (based on name + title)
2. Uses AI to **write a tailored proposal** showing how *my AI agency* (or yours, if you adapt it) can solve their pain point and integrate with the tools they already use
3. Generates a full PDF with suggestions, framed like a consultant's recommendation

Right now it uses a basic LLM chain, but you could easily plug in RAG for better retrieval and even more specific use cases.

It honestly feels like magic and it's been super fun to build.

If you’re curious or want to try it on your own LinkedIn profile, message me.

Would love any feedback or ideas to take it further."

I previously integrated WhatsApp via Facebook Developers and N8N. However, once I started using the API with my number, I could no longer use the WhatsApp Business app, which made things complicated.

In particular, I had to rely on workarounds to access chat history, and overall, it disrupted my usual workflow.

1,When to use AI vs Code for  enterprise-grade systems (lessons from a Japanese invoice bot),automation,gleb_ai_automation,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1lrllqg/when_to_use_ai_vs_code_for_enterprisegrade/,"After building a complex invoice automation, here's what I learned about balancing AI and traditional logic in n8n:**When AI Excels:**

* Unstructured text interpretation
* Handling document variations

* Language-specific nuances (Japanese negative line items were tricky)

**When Code Wins:**

* Data validation and cleaning
* Structured output formatting
* Error handling and retry logic
* Performance-critical operations

**The Hybrid Approach:**  
My workflow uses Claude 3.5 for extraction, then JavaScript nodes for validation. This combo gives 99%+ accuracy vs 85% with AI alone.**Architecture Highlights:**

* Parallel processing branches
* Sophisticated merge operations
* Real-time error notifications
* Automatic file organization

**Business Impact:**  
Turned this into a $2000/month service. Key was positioning as ""premium automation"" rather than competing on price with basic solutions.**For Fellow Freelancers:**

* Niche expertise commands premium pricing
* Professional error handling impresses clients
* Real-time notifications create perceived value
* Document the complexity to justify rates

1,Career Transition Advice,automation,KaleidoscopeScared66,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1lrjlwr/career_transition_advice/,"Hi there, I've worked for nonprofits (elections and advocacy) for 15 years, working my way up to second in command of a 100 person organization with tremendous resources.

I'm really intrigued by AI. A lot of folks in my field are taking what I think is a bad stance -- outright rejecting it because the potential harm outweighs the good. That will do no one any good when corporations are calling the shots for all of us, but I digress.

My skills are non-technical and mostly about organization and campaign management. But that's why I see all the potential for AI in the work that we do, especially when it comes to things like audience targeting and engagement or workflow automation that could free up so much time (and fight the burnot crisis?).

I've been collating courses to take, newsletters to read, and have started to practice building gpts. I plan to start practicing automating personal workflows soon. If you have any advice on courses to take I would greatly appreciate it! I can't afford to go to grad school.

I'd really like to transition fully to a mostly non-technical AI career, maybe focused on bringing the benefits of AI to nonprofit and social impact causes. What's the best way to do this transition? I was thinking about reaching out to AI orgs that may have some kind of political focus or are politically adjacent and basically offering to work for them for an extremely low rate just so I can learn more.

What do you all think? Please be kind...I know I am not a software engineer and my skillset isn't exactly ideal, but I've heard there are non-technical pathways."

I’m a BA by trade so the real effort comes in speccing out the requirements in detail before building. Now as a BA I can comfortably charge £500pd but I’m not just acting as a BA for these clients as I then build the solutions and test it with them to ensure it’s fit for purpose before they go live. In an ideal world I’d want a one size fits all pricing package but requirements just don’t work that way. Of course once the application is live there’s maintenance, updates and hosting to factor in along with new development because of course - people want more when they realise the are of the possible. Interested to hear how other fellow solution providers have overcome this step?

Stereo typical application involves 

* initial understanding with client
* wireframing and requirements capture
* skeleton build (React, MongoDB, S3)
* full stack dev
* testing

What are some brokerages I should consider and things I should look for when considering which to join, beyond whomever offers the best split? What do you wish you had known or considered? Any brokerages I should absolutely stay away from?

About me: 

I wanted to get my real estate license because I am getting more interested in working for myself and having more control over what work I take on and when. I like the idea of the relative flexibility of being a real estate agent. 

I have a mostly corporate and business-focused background and an MBA with an advanced engineering degree. I would find it interesting to apply my business background to commercial and industrial deals, but am not adverse to residential/vacation homes. Investment properties would also be interesting. I would probably try to get my NH and/or ME licenses in the future for vacation properties, for example. 

I have a decent network among higher net worth individuals (top business schools, MBB consulting and private equity friends) in MA which I hope to leverage, but am not afraid to hustle for new connections and clients either. I would like to keep my clientele in higher property value range (though that's not too hard with the high prices in MA honestly....)

I feel like I would want a place that offers some training as someone totally new to this industry, but am very comfortable with planning and self-motivating. 

  
Any advice would be highly appreciated!"
